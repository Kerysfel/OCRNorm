    "ROBBERY AT A BARONET''S. EDWARD PRING, twenty-seven, cabinet-maker, was brought
    up on remand at the Greenwich Police Court, charged with stealing jewellery to
    the value of £100, the property of Sir Robert Cunliffe, Bart., 2, LIP., of 37
    Lansdowne Street, Belgravia. Chief Inspector Phillips said there were several
    charges against the prisoner, all the robberies alleged being under similar circumstances.
    The prisoner was taken into custody, it appeared, on a charge of stealing a watch
    and other articles, value £12, from the residence of Miss Kene, 8 Belgrave Terrace,
    Lee. The prisoner called at the house and represented that he had been sent by
    the landlord to see to the blinds. He was given access to the bedrooms, and after
    he had gone, a watch, two rings, and two lockets were stolen. His statement of
    having been sent to the house was found to be false. The prisoner was ultimately
    arrested on this charge, and he was subsequently charged with the robbery from
    Sir R. Cunliffe upon information given by a young woman charged before the magistrate
    with the unlawful possession of a diamond ring. Robert Yellam, footman to Sir
    Robert, deposed that on March 28 the prisoner came to the house and said he had
    come to measure the blinds. Witness said new blinds were not required, whereupon
    prisoner said he had been sent to put some new springs. He was permitted to go
    upstairs, and witness afterwards let him out at the front door. The house was
    being painted. Sir Robert Cunliffe was sworn, and said a quantity of jewellery
    was missed on the evening of March 23 by Lady Cunliffe, with whom he had been
    out during the day. It was taken from the drawers in her dressing-table. He had
    since identified a pair of paste buckles, gold locket, emerald ring, two diamond
    rings, pair of crystal studs, Normanby cross, single taste buckle, earbuncle locket,
    pair of earrings, and two other rings. Other articles of jewellery and a purse
    containing £4 in gold and a £5 note were stolen. Jane Pring, mother of the prisoner,

    SERVANTS AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS. A I I . 1 _ I I _ - -__s _ -__ OT Saturday, at
    the Croydon petty sessions, Percy Davis, alias Gordon, a clerk, and Robert Everett,
    alias Davenport, two fashionably-attired young men, of 47 Aickenlad-road, Vauxhall,
    and Elizabeth Williams, described as a general servant, were charged on remand
    with being concerned together in stealing from the dwelling-house, 3 Prior-terrace,
    St. James''s-road, Croydon, since October, 1881, various items including gold
    chains, diamond rings, cameo brooches, gold seals, silver forks and spoons, and
    about £20 in silver money, the property of Mary Ann Cosens, valued altogether
    at about £50. Robert Everett, father of the prisoner of that name, was charged
    with receiving the property well knowing it to have been stolen, and he was further
    charged with unlawfully pledging the same. The last-named prisoner was for some
    years a superintendent in the Dorsetshire constabulary. Mr. Young, who appeared
    for the prosecution, said that his client, Mrs. Cosens, was an invalid lady eighty-two
    years of age, and quite unable to attend the court owing to her infirmity. In
    September last she engaged the female prisoner as a confidential servant and attendant,
    and she was the only person who had access to the jewellery. Shortly after entering
    Mrs. Cosens'' service, the prisoner Davis gained admission to the house under
    the pretence of paying his addresses to the girl, and he had evidently slept on
    the premises and enticed the girl to steal her mistress''s jewellery, which he
    took away and pledged, spending the proceeds about the town. Everett shortly afterwards
    came upon the scene and carried out the same kind of proceeding. Emily Barlow,
    cook to the prosecutrix, stated that the prisoners first came to the house in
    soldier''s clothes, which they afterwards exchanged for civilian dresses. They
    used to eat up to breakfast about half-past eleven o''clock in the morning, and
    helped themselves to dinner, the witness cooking the food out of her mistress''s
    money. Davis was apparently courting Williams, and a servant named Smith, aged
    twenty-three, used to visit the house on the evenings in the week and keep company
    with Everett. During the courtship she also slept in the house. Witness was not
    aware of the jewellery having been stolen. Detective Forster was then called to
    prove the arrest of the elder Everett. The accused said: "My son gave me the things
    to pledge, as I was better known and could get more money." He told me that the
    articles had been given to him by a relative. There were several other witnesses
    who testified to the prisoners'' conduct, and the case was adjourned for further

    Rusholme Police-station, where she now lies, The full circumstances of the case
    appear to be as follows :-The unfortunate woman is the wife a, of jThomras Hibbert,
    joiner and builder. About at twelve months ago Mrs. Hibbert gave birth to w a
    child, She fell ill, and finally became insane, She n was removed to the Parkfield
    Asyloam, near Maccles- r, field, of which institution she was an inmate up till
    y the 3rd of this month. On that day her husband took l her home, although warned
    that she was not perfectly o sane, and that a strict watch would have to be kept
    le over her actions. He proposed to hire a nurse, but l0 Mrs. Hibbert appeared
    to be very much upset at such a notion being entertained that the idea was abandoned.
    is On Friday morning he left for work as usual, leaving f 3. instructions for
    the servant to look after his wife. 2 .s Shortly after his departure Airs. Hibbert
    called the d s children upstairs to her, and was upstairs for about t is half
    an hour. She came down looking very ill, The s a servant became alarmed, and called
    in a neighbour. n They went upstairs and heard a splashing in the bath. c o They
    went into the room and found Mrs. Hibbert in i the bath. She then told them the
    two children were a eInptairs, but. sshe did not thihsni they were dead, She -
    J also told them she had been trying to drown herself. kThey at once went and
    gave information to the police. t e .LATER DETAILS, d Upon farther inquiries being
    made, the following C details were ascertained. About a year ago Mrs. t Hibbert
    was confined of a child, The week following tI she fell ill, ultimately becoming
    insane, necessitating t her removal to the Parkfield Asylum, Macelesfield. t She
    was detained in that institution until Wednesday, when she was taken out by her
    husband. He was told she was not perfectly convalescent. He. stated his intention
    of providing a nurse for her, but that seemedn to excite Mrs. Hibbert to such
    an extent that the idea e was reluctantly abandoned. Mrs. Hibbert rose about Si
    half past seven on Friday morning and had breakfast b with her husband. She then
    appeared to be in her usual health, bodily and mentally. M1r. Hibbert left a the
    house about eight oclock in order to proceed to his uN work, but prior to his
    doing so he gave strict orders to his servant to keep an eye upon her mistresss
    move- ments. About nine oclock Mrs. Hibbert told the servant to call the children
    in from playing in the front vi garden. Mrs. Hibbert took hold of the children
    and C took them upstairs with her. She came down shortly 6* afterwards and sent
    the servant for a bottle of soda, a saying that she felt very unwell. On the servants
    a! return with the soda water, she asked her mistress what P had become of the
    children. Mrs. Hibbert replied that they had gone to the corner shop. The servant
    went of to inquire if they were there, but was told they had never been there.
    Becoming alarmed,/she procured a I neighbour named Mrs. Deedle to go back to the
    house t with her, as she suspected something was the matter. d On reaching the
    house they heard a splashing in the d bathroom. They proceeded thither, and found
    Mrs. 1Hibbert in the bath. They asked her where the chil i dren were, and Mrs.
    Hibbert replied, I have dro wned | l them, I dont think they are dead, as they
    are quite warns. She took theum into a bedroom where the two al children were
    found lying quite naked on the bed, and h although the bodies were warm they were
    perfectly h dead. Airs. Hibbert also told thetm she had been t trying to drown

    intention of providing a nurse for her, but that seemedn to excite Mrs. Hibbert
    to such an extent that the idea e was reluctantly abandoned. Mrs. Hibbert rose
    about Si half past seven on Friday morning and had breakfast b with her husband.
    She then appeared to be in her usual health, bodily and mentally. M1r. Hibbert
    l'eft a the house about eight o'clock in order to proceed to his uN work, but
    prior to his doing so he gave strict orders to his servant to keep an eye upon
    her mistress's move- ments. About nine o'clock Mrs. Hibbert told the servant to
    call the children in from playing in the front vi garden. Mrs. Hibbert took hold
    of the children and C took them upstairs with her. She came down shortly 6* afterwards
    and sent the servant for a bottle of soda, a saying that she felt very unwell.
    On the servant's a! return with the soda water, she asked her mistress what P
    had become of the children. Mrs. Hibbert replied that they had gone to the corner
    shop. The servant went of to inquire if they were there, but was told they had
    never been there. Becoming alarmed,/she procured a I neighbour named Mrs. Deedle
    to go back to the house t with her, as she suspected something was the matter.
    d On reaching the house they heard a splashing in the d bathroom. They proceeded
    thither, and found Mrs. 1Hibbert in the bath. They asked her where the chil i
    'dren were, and Mrs. Hibbert replied, " I have dro wned | l them, I don't think
    they are dead, as they are quite warns." She took theum into a bedroom where the
    two al children were found lying quite naked on the bed, and h although the bodies
    were warm they were perfectly h dead. Airs. Hibbert also told thetm she had been
    t trying to drown herself in the bath for the last half |S hour. On receipt of

    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    ABOUT noon on Friday information was received at the Rusholme

    Police-station that a woman had murdered her two children, aged three

    and five respectively, and then attempted to commit suicide by drowning.

    Upon the information being received Inspector Smith went at once with

    the person who gave the information to No. 54, Moss-side. On making a

    detailed examination of the premises he found the two children lying on

    a bed in one of the bedrooms naked and quite dead, apparently from

    drowning. Upon the body of one of the children there was a piece of

    paper containing some almost illegible writing. What portions of it that

    could be made out rang as follows :-- “Dear Papa, -- I could not stand

    it any longer . . . . to you. I do not think they are dead, for they . .

    . We shall never meet in heaven. I could not help it. I had a good

    husband.” The inspector took Mrs. Hibbert to the Rusholme

    Police-station, where she now lies. The full circumstances of the case

    appear to be as follows: -- The unfortunate woman is the wife of Thomas

    Hibbert, joiner and builder. About twelve months ago Mrs. Hibbert gave

    birth to a child. She fell ill, and finally became insane. She was

    removed to the Parkfield Asylum, near Macclesfield, of which institution

    she was an inmate up till the 3rd of this month. On that day her husband

    took her home, although warned that she was not perfectly sane, and that

    a strict watch would have to be kept over her actions. He proposed to

    hire a nurse, but Mrs. Hibbert appeared to be very much upset at such a

    notion being entertained that the idea was abandoned. On Friday morning

    he left for work as usual, leaving instructions for the servant to look

    after his wife. Shortly after his departure Mrs. Hibbert called the

    children upstairs to her, and was upstairs for about half an hour. She

    came down looking very ill. The servant became alarmed, and called in a

    neighbour. They went upstairs and heard a splashing in the bath. They

    went into the room and found Mrs. Hibbert in the bath. She then told

    them the two children were upstairs, but she did not think they were

    dead. She also told them she had been trying to drown herself. They at

    once went and gave information to the police.


    LATER DETAILS.


    Upon further inquiries being made, the following details were

    ascertained. About a year ago Mrs. Hibbert was confined of a child. The

    week following she fell ill, ultimately becoming insane, necessitating

    her removal to the Parkfield Asylum, Macclesfield. She was detained in

    that institution until Wednesday, when she was taken out by her husband.

    He was told she was not perfectly convalescent. He stated his intention

    of providing a nurse for her, but that seemed to excite Mrs. Hibbert to

    such an extent that the idea was reluctantly abandoned. Mrs. Hibbert

    rose about half-past seven on Friday morning and had breakfast with her

    husband. She then appeared to be in her usual health, bodily and

    mentally. Mr. Hibbert left the house about eight o’clock in order to

    proceed to his work, but prior to his doing so he gave strict orders to

    his servant to keep an eye upon her mistress’s movements. About nine

    o’clock Mrs. Hibbert told the servant to call the children in from

    playing in the front garden. Mrs. Hibbert took hold of the children and

    took them upstairs with her. She came down shortly afterwards and sent

    the servant for a bottle of soda, saying that she felt very unwell. On

    the servant’s return with the soda water, she asked her mistress what

    had become of the children. Mrs. Hibbert replied that they had gone to

    the corner shop. The servant went to inquire if they were there, but was

    told they had never been there. Becoming alarmed, she procured a

    neighbour named Mrs. Deedle to go back to the house with her, as she

    suspected something was the matter. On reaching the house they heard a

    splashing in the bathroom. They proceeded thither, and found Mrs.

    Hibbert in the bath. They asked her where the children were, and Mrs.

    Hibbert replied, “I have drowned them. I don’t think they are dead, as

    they are quite warm.” She took them into a bedroom where the two

    children were found lying quite naked on the bed, and although the

    bodies were warm they were perfectly dead. Mrs. Hibbert also told them

    she had been trying to drown herself in the bath for the last half hour.

    On receipt of this information Inspector smith went down to the house

    and made an examination of the premises. He found the two children lying

    "ST-TOT FIRING IN MINES.


    At the Gateshead County Police Court on Saturday, proceedings were taken by the
    Home Office against the manager of the Ireson Uiworth Colliery for illegal shooting.
    On March 2nd, for the day on which the disastrous explosion occurred at that colliery,
    in which forty-two lives were lost. The summons was issued against Mr. A. S. Palmer,
    who was present as agent of the colliery. Mr. Arnold Agar, M.P., appeared on behalf
    of the Crown, and Mr. R. F. Cooper, Newcastle, appeared for the owners.


    Mr. Morley said the prosecution was taken under 35 & 1W and 36 Vic., chap. 76,
    of the Mines Regulation Act. With regard to the use of gunpowder, it was provided
    that it should only be used in cartridges, and not within three months after any
    inflammable gas had been found in the mine. The prosecution relied on the fact
    that inflammable gas had been found in the mine within three months of the firing
    of the shot, and the question was whether the regulation had been complied with.
    It was also provided that persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be excluded
    from that part of it where the explosive was to be used.


    Mr. Cooper said it was not disputed that gas had been found, but it was not found
    within the conditions of the Act. He was prepared to prove that it was due to
    a temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation appliances, and was removed when
    the ventilation was put right. After evidence had been given on both sides, it
    was agreed between Mr. Morley and Mr. Cooper that the question at issue was really

    "THE POISONING CASE IN FRANCE. The trial of Petit for poisoning his first wife—his
    second is still living—and a servant who was also his mistress, has resulted in
    a verdict of guilty against the prisoner on the second count, although the jury
    were unable to make up their minds as to convict him on the first count, despite
    the declared presence of arsenic in the exhumed remains of his wife. Although
    these were the only two charges preferred against Petit, he is also suspected
    of having poisoned his mother as long ago as 1872, and of attempting to poison
    the lives of an old woman named Marie Mahoin and a girl named Eugénie Meyer, both
    of whom were at different times in his service. The girl Meyer, who frequently
    suffered from severe vomiting while she was in Petit''s service, has never been
    seen since, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor during the trial that
    Petit had poisoned her and disposed of her body, as he is believed to have disposed
    of that of Elise Blohliner, his servant and mistress, whose case is almost parallel
    with that of Eugénie Meyer. It must be said that the explanation as to what had
    become of the missing women and the cause of death of his mother and first wife
    were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him was almost entirely
    circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a verdict of guilty was entered.
    There has, however, already been much comment on the fact that the prisoner was
    practically acquitted of the charge against his wife, whose remains were found
    to contain poison, and convicted of a charge of which absolutely no trace exists,
    as there are only some cinders from the stove in which the victim''s body is supposed
    to have been burnt, and which are assumed to be all that remains of her mutilated
    corpse. M. Henri Rochefort, in the Journal des Debats, says that the verdict against
    Petit is the first instance of a man being found guilty of murder for poison when
    neither the body nor the victim''s body has been found. La France calls attention
    to the fact that the jury gave a negative answer in the case of Petit''s first
    wife, in whose remains distinct traces of arsenic were discovered, and an affirmative
    answer in the indictment against the prisoner for the murder of Elise Boehiner,
    although in the latter case the accusation was only supported by medical conjecture.
    La France also calls attention to the lamentable defense that was made on the
    prisoner''s behalf. The Figaro thanks the jury for having resolutely saved society
    from the possible repetition of similar crimes by bringing in a verdict of guilty.

    THE trial of Pel on the double charge of poisoning his first wife – his

    second is still living – and a servant who was also his mistress, has

    resulted in a verdict of guilty against the prisoner on the second

    count, although the jury were unable to make up their minds to convict

    him on the first, notwithstanding the declared presence of arsenic in

    the exhumed remains of his wife. Although these were the only two

    charges preferred against Pel, he is also suspected of having poisoned

    his mother as long ago as 1872, and of having attempted the lives, in a

    similar manner, of an old woman named Marie Mahoin and a girl named

    Eugénie Meyer, both of whom were at different times in Pel’s service.

    The girl Meyer, indeed, who frequently suffered from severe vomiting

    while she was in Pel’s service, has never been seen since Pel announced

    that she had left him, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor

    during the trial that Pel had poisoned her and disposed of the body, as

    he is believed to have disposed of that of Elise Boehmer, his servant

    and mistress, whose case, therefore, is almost parallel with that of

    Eugénie Meyer. It must be said that Pel’s explanation as to what had

    become of the missing women, and the cause of death of his mother and

    first wife, were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him

    was almost entirely circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a

    verdict of guilty was entered. There has, however, already been much

    comment on the fact that the prisoner was practically acquitted of the

    charge against his wife, whose remains were found to contain poison, and

    convicted of a charge of which absolutely no trace exists, save some

    cinders from the stove in which the victim’s body is supposed to have

    been burnt, and which are assumed to be all that remains of her

    incinerated corpse. M. Henri Rochefort, in the Intransigent, says that

    the verdict against Pel is the first instance of a man being found

    guilty of murder for poison when neither the poison nor the victim’s

    body has been found. La France calls attention to the fact that the jury

    gave a negative answer in the case of Pel’s first wife, in whose remains

    distinct traces of arsenic were discovered, and an affirmative answer in

    the indictment against the prisoner for the murder of Elise Boehmer,

    although in the latter case the accusation was only supported by medical

    conjecture. La France also calls attention to the lamentable defence

    that was made on the prisoner’s behalf. The Figaro thanks the jury for

    having resolutely saved society from the possible repetition of similar

    crimes by bringing in a verdict of guilty. Pel had been removed to be

    condemned cell at La Roquette prison. Since his conviction Pel has

    displayed more emotion and continues to earnestly declare his innocence.

    Pell has been sentenced to death.'

    "ATTEMPTED MURDER OF A MERCHANT. AT the Bow-street Police-court, five men named
    James Palmer, Samuel Scandland, Leon Weiner, Adolphe Weiner, and Daniel Jacoby,
    have been charged with being concerned with a man already convicted named Dasant,
    with attempting to murder Jules Tabak, a diamond merchant, and stealing £2000
    worth of diamonds. Inspector Langrish deposed that from information received he
    went with other officers and arrested the accused on the present charge. Mr. Taliak,
    a diamond merchant, of 5 Belgrave-street, Euston-road, deposed that on March 2nd,
    two men came to his house and asked him to show them some diamonds. Two parcels
    were shown them, while the men were looking at the diamonds, the prisoner Palmer
    struck witness two heavy blows on the head. He was stunned, the two men ran away,
    and stole one hundred and eighty carats of diamonds, value £1410. One of the men,
    Doeant, was arrested, and has since been convicted and sentenced to penal servitude.
    He positively identified Palmer as the other man. Mr. Taliak was called, and identified
    Palmer as one of the men concerned in the robbery. She did not identify him at
    first, Eleanor Denunzio, the daughter of the man Dasant, deposed that on March
    25th, the day of the robbery, the prisoner Palmer called on her and beckoned her
    to the corner of the street. He asked for her father. He said, "I struck the old
    man. He screamed, and his wife came upstairs, and we were obliged to run away."
    She packed up her luggage and took it to Waterloo Station, and afterwards went
    to Adolphe Weiner''s house. She packed the luggage and sent it to Waiterloo Station
    the same day. She then went to C. Dyers Buildings, and saw Adolphe Weiner. Directly
    he saw her, he said, "For God''s sake go away; I will meet you in Castle-street."
    She went there, where he shortly joined her, and took her to a jeweler''s shop
    in Chancery-lane. Witness said, "You have got my father into this trouble, and
    I shall expect you to get him out of it." He denied at first that he knew anything
    about it. She told him that her father had told her about the affair from the
    beginning. He said that all he did was to get her father a situation. She said
    she knew that was false, and that he sent her father to Mr. Tabak. First he said
    he would not assist her at all, and then he gave her 5s. 3d., and said he would
    give her that every week until she got employment. He said whatever she did, she
    must not come near Dyers-Buildings, because he was watched. Then she went to Jacoby''s
    house, but he was not at home. She saw him the following Friday at his place in
    the Edgware-road. He said he did not know they were going to strike him. Witness
    told him he must take the money for her father''s maintenance in the House of
    Detention. He promised to do so, and met her on the following Monday in Avonmore-street,
    Clerkenwell. She gave him 3s. for her father. On the following Wednesday she was
    to meet Weiner, who promised to give her £2 12s. for the rent then due by her
    father. Weiner did not turn up, but subsequently she saw Jacoby, who gave her

    the case of Dver and Son r, Irs. Neal and Mr. S. Carler has been tried by Judge
    Prentiee, The plaintiffs are piano-forte makers, of 14 Stoke Newington-road, and
    they claimed of Mrs. Neal, who is a laundress, and Mr. Carter, an oilman, the
    sum of £2:3 2s., the value of the piano detained, and £2 2s., damages for the
    defendants claiming that they had hired the instrument to their own use. Mr. Pillmore
    appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Davis was counsel for the defendants. The
    plaintiffs claimed that in December, 1873, Mrs. Neal had taken the piano on hire
    from them, and the hire money was £283 2s., and £2 2s. was paid at once, and the
    remainder was to be paid at the rate of £1 a month, the piano to become her property
    if she kept it for three months. After paying £30, Mrs. Neal discovered that the

    AT the Shoreditch County Court the case of Dyer and Son v. Mrs. Neal and

    Mr. S. Carter has been tried by Judge Prentice. The plaintiffs are

    pianoforte manufacturers, of 14 Stoke Newington-road, and they claimed

    of Mrs. Neal, who is a laundress, and Mr. Carter, an oilman, the sum of

    £23 2s., the value of a piano detained, and £22s, damages for the

    defendants having converted the instrument to their own use. Mr. Palmor

    appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Davis was counsel for the

    defendants. The plaintiffs'' case was that in December, 1884, Mrs. Neal

    had a piano of them upon the hire system. The cost of the instrument was

    £23 2s., and £22s, was paid at once, and the remainder was to be paid at

    the rate of £1 1s. a month, the piano to become her property if she paid

    all the instalments. After paying three instalments she got into

    arrears, but in August last, when £6 6s was due, she paid £8 10s.,

    making £13 15s, paid altogether. Soon after that she moved away, and it

    was about two months before she was found. It was then discovered that

    the defendant Carter, who was her landlord, had taken the piano in pawn

    for rent. The sum of £4 10s, was due for rent, and Mrs. Neal under took

    to per £46 in six months or forfeit the piano, Cross-examined: The

    agreement was read over to Mrs. Neal -fore she signed it. His Honour:

    Why did she pay £8 10s, when only £6 6s, was due? The # said it was of

    her own free will, His Honour: People do not usually pay more than is

    due. In answer to further questions, it was admitted for plaintiffs that

    they were told they could hare the piano if they paid £6, the amount of

    the indebtedness of Mrs. Neal to Mr. Carter, but they refused to do

    that. They were also offered the balance due on the agreement for the

    piano, but they refused to accept it. His Honour, in the result, said he

    must hold that the agreement was good, but be would assist the

    defendants as much as he could. The plaintiffs acted very improperly in

    not accepting the balance due under the agreement when it was rendered.

    He was very sorry that he must give a verdict in their favour, but he

    should only allow 1s damages, £9 7s. the balance of the £23 2s. and £2

    9s, 10d. the costs of the court. Had the £9 7s. held paid into court he

    would have given judgment for the defendants.'

    "THE ALLEGED LOAN OFFICE FRAUDS.


    At the Marlborough-street Police Court on Saturday, JOHN DAVIES, an ironmonger
    of Lansdown-place, Brunswick-square; GEORGE DENNY RUCK, alias FOSTER, a clerk
    of Paradise-street, Lambeth; and JOHN JACKSON, a traveller of Braden-street, Maida
    Vale, were charged on remand with conspiring to obtain various sums of money.
    Three cases have already been investigated against the accused.


    Mr. EUGENE PRATT, a merchant, stated that in consequence of an advertisement which
    appeared in a daily paper in January last, he went to the office of FOSTER and
    CO., Argyll-street. He there saw RUCK, and told him that he wanted to borrow £4
    0s. stating that he had goods which were worth about £600. He left the office
    but returned again the same day when he saw DAVIES. He was informed that expenses
    would be incurred in making inquiries and was asked for a guinea, which he paid.
    Subsequently, he gave RUCK 10s. on being informed that the surveyor had been unable
    to see the goods at the wharf where they were lying, and that he would have to
    call there again to inspect them, which would entail additional expense. No money
    was ever advanced to him by the prisoners.


    Mrs. MARY McCLINTOCK stated that owing to an advertisement that appeared in one
    of the papers she went to the prisoners'' offices in Argyll-street, where she
    saw RUCK and told him she wanted to borrow £25. She was asked for a fee of 10s.
    6d. for inquiries, which she paid, and she also deposited the lease of her house
    and gave two references. She called again at the offices on July 3rd when DAVIES
    tried to kiss her, having previously sent RUCK out of the room on the pretence
    that he was going to cash a cheque, and that she would then be paid the money
    she wanted. When RUCK returned he said he had been unable to cash the cheque as
    DAVIES had forgotten to sign it. She then demanded her 10s. 6d. back and told
    them that the whole thing was a conspiracy, and that they would hear more of it.


    Edward BLAIR, a grocer of Croydon, stated that he applied for a loan at the office
    in Argyll-street and paid 10s. 6d. as an inquiry fee. Eventually, he was induced
    to deposit the lease of his premises with one of the prisoners on the understanding
    that he was to get a loan of £30. He paid RUCK a guinea for the expense of preparing
    the agreement. He never received any money from the prisoners.


    At this stage, the accused were again remanded for a week, bail being refused."'

    "I ATTEMPTED MURDER AT STAMFORD HILL. ON Saturday night an extraordinary and apparently
    deliberate attempt to murder a woman, the wife of a house and estate agent named
    Tomlinson, of 7, Champion-terrace, Stamford Hill, took place in the public thoroughfare,
    about one hundred yards distance from her residence. She left home at twenty minutes
    past nine for the purpose of making a few purchases, and was almost immediately
    accosted by a man from behind. She turned round at once, and found that it was
    her sister''s husband, William Esworthy. He walked by her side for a second or
    two, and then suddenly fired a pistol at the back of her head. She screamed, ''Murder!''
    and fell to the ground insensible. A girl living on the spot ran across the road
    and recognized Mrs. Tomlinson as she lay bleeding on the pavement. Being Saturday
    night, there were many people about. A crowd soon assembled, and the injured woman
    was carried into her own house. Dr. Duncan of Amherst Park was sent for, and he
    found her suffering from a bullet wound behind the right ear, but the bullet had
    not penetrated the skull, having bounded off after striking the bone. Search was
    subsequently made for the bullet, but it could not be found. After the woman fell,
    Esworthy hurried to the opposite side of the street and threw something over a
    fence. He had been seen to fire the pistol by some passersby, and was seized by
    several men who took him towards the Stoke Newington Police Station. They were
    met by Sergeant Collins of the N Division, to whom they reported the circumstances
    of the case and gave the man into his custody. Collins, accompanied by a great
    many persons, conveyed Esworthy to the Tottenham Police Station. There he was
    charged with shooting and wounding with intent to murder one Harriet Tomlinson
    at the High Road, Stamford Hill in the parish of Tottenham. On the charge being
    read over to him, he remarked, ''She did it herself, and I took the revolver away
    from her and threw it over a fence on the opposite side of the road.'' On being
    searched, a few coins and a cleaning rod of a pistol were found upon him, but
    no ammunition. The prisoner having been locked up, Inspector Ashwell and Sergeant
    Collins proceeded to the spot indicated by him to search for the revolver, but
    after a close inspection for an hour or so, they had not succeeded in finding
    it. The search was then discontinued. It was resumed on Sunday morning at daylight
    by Sergeant Collins, and at a quarter past five o''clock he discovered the revolver
    in a builder''s yard almost opposite where the crime was committed. It is a weapon
    with seven chambers, six of which were loaded when it was picked up. It was therefore
    fully charged when the attack was made upon Mrs. Tomlinson. In investigating the
    matter on Sunday, the police ascertained that the prisoner spent nearly the whole
    of Saturday afternoon and evening watching the playing of cricket on some vacant
    land at the rear of Champion Terrace. After the match was over, he was seen to
    pass Tomlinson''s place of business and go to a public house where he had some
    whisky. He then re-passed the shop and waited about in the expectation that Mrs.
    Tomlinson would come out, as she eventually did, to make Saturday night purchases.
    As to the motive for the outrage, it is stated that there had been serious disagreements
    between the prisoner and his wife, and that Mrs. Tomlinson had supported her sister''s
    cause and invited her to come to Stamford Hill and stay there on several occasions,
    which she had done. Mrs. Tomlinson is the mother of two children and is much respected
    by her neighbors, who express great sympathy towards her in her suffering and
    make anxious inquiries as to her condition. It is clear that she had a miraculous
    escape from death. As it is, she is badly wounded and her system has received
    a very severe shock, but there is scarcely any fear of her ultimate recovery.
    On Sunday evening the symptoms were highly favorable to that view. The affair,
    happening in a crowded thoroughfare at a busy time on Saturday night, created
    intense excitement."'

    chambers, six of which were loaded when it was picked up. It was,

    therefore, fully charged when the attack was made upon Mrs. Tomlinson.


    In investigating the matter on Sunday the police ascertained that the

    prisoner spent nearly the whole of Saturday afternoon and evening

    watching the playing of cricket on some vacant land at the rear of

    Champion-terrace. After the match was over he was seen to pass

    Tomlinson''s place of business and go to a public-house, where he had

    some whisky. He then repassed the shop, and evidently waited about in

    the expectation that Mrs. Tomlinson would come out, as she eventually

    did, to make Saturday night''s purchases. As to the motive for the

    outrage, it is stated that there had been serious disagreements between

    the prisoner and his wife, and that Mrs. Tomlinson had supported her

    sister''s cause, and invited her to come to Stamford Hill and stay there

    on several occasions, which she had done. Mrs. Tomlinson, is the mother

    of two children, and is much respected by her neighbours, who express

    great sympathy towards her in her suffering, and make anxious inquiries

    as to her condition. It is clear that she had a miraculous escape from

    death. As it is she is badly wounded, and her system has received a very

    severe shock, but there is scarcely any fear of her ultimate recovery.

    On Sunday evening the symptoms were highly favourable to that view. Ae

    may be imagined, the affair, happening in a crowded thoroughfare at a

    busy time on Saturday night, created intense excitement. Prisoner will

    be taken before the magistrates at Edmonton in a day or two.'

    "THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AND THE REPORTER.


    In the Queen''s Bench Division, on Friday, before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr.
    Justice Hawkins, Mr. Abinger moved for an order, calling upon Mr. Bridge, the
    Bow-street magistrate, to show cause why he should not hear and determine an application
    for a summons applied for by Mr. Simms, described as a reporter, against the Duke
    of Cambridge, for an assault committed on May 25th, on the occasion of the Prince
    and Princess of Wales inspecting the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.


    On the 28th, Mr. Bridge suggested that the case was one for the County Court,
    but the complainant did not accept the suggestion, and went on to make his complaint.
    The information was read, but not sworn, the learned magistrate refusing to allow
    it to be sworn, and he declined to grant a summons.


    In the information, the applicant stated the details of the alleged assault, which
    took place at the Horse Guards, Whitehall. An affidavit to a similar effect was
    also read by the learned counsel, who contended that all the elements of an assault
    which it was possible to bring were present.


    After arguments, Lord Chief Justice Coleridge said that it was of the greatest
    importance that the public should be satisfied that before the law all subjects
    of the Queen are equal. He had not a shadow of opinion as to what might be the
    issue of the case, but it was clear to his mind that Mr. Bridge had not exercised
    his discretion, which he was bound to exercise judicially, and therefore the rule
    must be granted. Mr. Justice Hawkins concurred.


    Mr. Abinger asked whether the rule would be nisi or absolute. Their lordships
    pointed out that at present they had only heard Mr. Abinger, and the magistrate
    might have an explanation. Rule nisi granted.


    At the West Bromwich Police Court, on Friday, a man named Thomas Francis Sinclair
    was remanded on a charge of attempting to murder George Williams. The men slept
    together, and on Wednesday the accused is alleged to have jumped out of bed and
    to have fetched a knife and stabbed Williams. It has been stated that both men
    were in love with the same girl, and that the deed arose out of jealousy, but
    the girl denies the story.


    A lunatic patient, named Harris, in the Royal Naval Hospital at Great Yarmouth,
    made a violent attack on Friday morning upon two other patients, named Miller
    and Parkes, with a red-hot poker. Both lie in a very dangerous state. Dr. Browne,
    one of the hospital doctors, had his head and arm injured while trying to disarm
    Harris, and Mr. Cummins, who eventually wrestled the poker from the man, had his
    hands burned. An official named Kelly also received a terrible blow on the head."'

    in Glyn-road, Clapton-park, supposed for the purpose of committing a felony. The

    They had evidently made the place their home. The elder boy was armed with a catapult,
    and in his possession were a number of lead pellets, which he had obtained by
    melting down the lead from the building''s piping. The extensive building had
    been almost stripped of its piping, and there were evidences that the lead had
    been melted down to make pellets for the catapults, which were used to shoot the
    numerous birds nested in the roof of the building. The birds were afterwards cooked
    and eaten. On the house where Arnold resided being searched, a chisel fashioned
    like a burglar''s tool was found, as well as a silver-plated teapot and cream
    jug, and several plated spoons, which had been stolen from a house in Percy-terrace,
    Mandeville-street, Clapton. The owner was not present, and Constable 208 J said
    there was no further evidence to connect the prisoners with the robbery at that

    A wall eight feet high surrounded the building, and as the inner staircase had
    long since disappeared, he was at a loss to know how the boys got to the top floor.
    Arnold said they got over the outer wall from some gardens at the back, and, having
    forced the windows, they climbed up the beams to the top floor. The solicitor
    added that great danger might arise to adjoining property by the boys indulging
    in fires on the floor. The boys seemed to have been neglected by their parents,
    one mother admitting that she had taken a situation as a housekeeper and left
    the boy to shift for himself. Mr. Corser said Bushell appeared to be the ringleader,
    and he probably had led the other boys away. He would have ten days imprisonment
    and be detained for five years in a reformatory. The younger boys would go to
