    father of the prisoner of the same name, was also charged with knowingly receiving
    the property and unlawfully pledging it. The last-mentioned prisoner was for some
    years a superintendent in the Dorsetshire constabulary. Mr. Young, who appeared
    for the prosecution, said that his client, Mrs. Cosens, was an invalid lady eighty-two
    years of age, and quite unable to attend the court owing to her infirmity. In
    September last she engaged the female prisoner as a confidential servant and attendant,
    and she was the only person who had access to the jewellery. Shortly after entering

    the time, under the pretense of paying, his addresses to the girl, he gained admission
    to the house, and there was no doubt that he had made the place his home. He had
    evidently slept on the premises, and enticed the girl to steal her mistress''
    jewellery, which he took away and pledged, and spent the proceeds about town.
    Everett shortly afterwards came upon the scene, and carried out the same kind
    of proceedings. Emily Barlow, cook to the prosecutrix, stated that the prisoners
    first appeared at the house in soldier clothes, which they afterwards exchanged
    for civilian dresses. They used to eat up to blackest about half-past eleven o''clock
    in the morning, and helped themselves to dinner, the witness cooking the same
    portions out of her mistress'' money. Davis was apparently courting Williams,
    and a servant named Smith, aged twenty-three, used to visit the house on evenings
    in the week, and keep company with Everett. During the courtship she also slept
    in the house. Witness was not aware of the jewellery having been stolen. Detective
    Forster was then called to prove the arrest of the elder Everett. The accused
    said: ''My son gave, no, the things to pledge, as I was better known, and could

    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    ABOUT noon on Friday information was received at the Rusholme

    Police-station that a woman had murdered her two children, aged three

    and five respectively, and then attempted to commit suicide by drowning.

    Upon the information being received Inspector Smith went at once with

    the person who gave the information to No. 54, Moss-side. On making a

    detailed examination of the premises he found the two children lying on

    a bed in one of the bedrooms naked and quite dead, apparently from

    drowning. Upon the body of one of the children there was a piece of

    paper containing some almost illegible writing. What portions of it that

    could be made out rang as follows :-- “Dear Papa, -- I could not stand

    it any longer . . . . to you. I do not think they are dead, for they . .

    . We shall never meet in heaven. I could not help it. I had a good

    husband.” The inspector took Mrs. Hibbert to the Rusholme

    Police-station, where she now lies. The full circumstances of the case

    appear to be as follows: -- The unfortunate woman is the wife of Thomas

    Hibbert, joiner and builder. About twelve months ago Mrs. Hibbert gave

    birth to a child. She fell ill, and finally became insane. She was

    removed to the Parkfield Asylum, near Macclesfield, of which institution

    she was an inmate up till the 3rd of this month. On that day her husband

    took her home, although warned that she was not perfectly sane, and that

    a strict watch would have to be kept over her actions. He proposed to

    hire a nurse, but Mrs. Hibbert appeared to be very much upset at such a

    notion being entertained that the idea was abandoned. On Friday morning

    he left for work as usual, leaving instructions for the servant to look

    after his wife. Shortly after his departure Mrs. Hibbert called the

    children upstairs to her, and was upstairs for about half an hour. She

    came down looking very ill. The servant became alarmed, and called in a

    neighbour. They went upstairs and heard a splashing in the bath. They

    went into the room and found Mrs. Hibbert in the bath. She then told

    them the two children were upstairs, but she did not think they were

    dead. She also told them she had been trying to drown herself. They at

    once went and gave information to the police.


    LATER DETAILS.


    Upon further inquiries being made, the following details were

    ascertained. About a year ago Mrs. Hibbert was confined of a child. The

    week following she fell ill, ultimately becoming insane, necessitating

    her removal to the Parkfield Asylum, Macclesfield. She was detained in

    that institution until Wednesday, when she was taken out by her husband.

    He was told she was not perfectly convalescent. He stated his intention

    of providing a nurse for her, but that seemed to excite Mrs. Hibbert to

    such an extent that the idea was reluctantly abandoned. Mrs. Hibbert

    rose about half-past seven on Friday morning and had breakfast with her

    husband. She then appeared to be in her usual health, bodily and

    mentally. Mr. Hibbert left the house about eight o’clock in order to

    proceed to his work, but prior to his doing so he gave strict orders to

    his servant to keep an eye upon her mistress’s movements. About nine

    o’clock Mrs. Hibbert told the servant to call the children in from

    playing in the front garden. Mrs. Hibbert took hold of the children and

    took them upstairs with her. She came down shortly afterwards and sent

    the servant for a bottle of soda, saying that she felt very unwell. On

    the servant’s return with the soda water, she asked her mistress what

    had become of the children. Mrs. Hibbert replied that they had gone to

    the corner shop. The servant went to inquire if they were there, but was

    told they had never been there. Becoming alarmed, she procured a

    neighbour named Mrs. Deedle to go back to the house with her, as she

    suspected something was the matter. On reaching the house they heard a

    splashing in the bathroom. They proceeded thither, and found Mrs.

    Hibbert in the bath. They asked her where the children were, and Mrs.

    Hibbert replied, “I have drowned them. I don’t think they are dead, as

    they are quite warm.” She took them into a bedroom where the two

    children were found lying quite naked on the bed, and although the

    bodies were warm they were perfectly dead. Mrs. Hibbert also told them

    she had been trying to drown herself in the bath for the last half hour.

    On receipt of this information Inspector smith went down to the house

    and made an examination of the premises. He found the two children lying

    dead on the bed. A piece of paper containing a few almost illegible

    sentences was laid on the body of the eldest child.'

- handwritten_text_corrected: '"THE POISONING CASE IN FRANCE. The trial of Peton for
    the double charge of poisoning his first wife—his second is still living—and a
    servant who was also his mistress, has resulted in a verdict of guilty against
    the prisoner on the second count, although the jury were unable to reach a decision
    as to convict him on the first, notwithstanding the declared presence of arsenic
    in the exhumed remains of his wife. Although these were the only two charges preferred
    against Pet, he is also suspected of having poisoned his mother as early as 1872,
    and of attempting the lives, in a similar manner, of an old woman named Maria
    Mahoin and a girl named Eugenie Meyer, both of whom were at different times in
    his service. The girl Meyer, indeed, who frequently suffered from severe vomiting
    while also she was in Pet''s service, has never been seen since he announced that
    she had left him, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor during the trial
    that he had poisoned her and disposed of the body, as he is believed to have disposed
    of that of Elise Blohliner, his servant and mistress, whose case, therefore, is
    nearly parallel with that of Eugenie Meyer. It must be said that the explanation
    as to what had become of the missing women, and the cause of death of his mother
    and first wife, were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him was
    almost entirely circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a verdict of guilty
    was entered. However, there has already been much comment on the fact that the
    prisoner was practically acquitted of the charge against his wife, whose remains
    were found to contain poison, and convicted of a charge of which absolutely no
    trace exists, as in some cinders from the stove in which the victim''s body is
    supposed to have been burned, and which are assumed to be all that remains of
    her incinerated corpse. M. Henri Rochefort, in the Journaliste, says that this
    verdict against Pet is the first instance of a man being found guilty of murder
    for poison when neither the poison nor the victim''s body has been found. Le Figaro
    calls attention to the fact that the jury gave a negative answer in the case of
    Pet''s first wife, in whose remains distinct traces of arsenic were discovered,
    and an affirmative answer in the indictment against the prisoner for the murder
    of Elise Blohliner, although in the latter case the accusation was only supported
    by medical conjecture. Le France also calls attention to the lamentable defense
    that was made on the prisoner''s behalf. The Figaro thanks the jury for having
    resolved absolutely to save society from the possible repetition of similar crimes
    by bringing in a verdict of guilty. Pet had been removed to the condemned cell
    at La Santé prison since his conviction, and he has displayed more emotion, and
    continues to earnestly declare his innocence. Pet has been sentenced to death."'

  typed_text: 'THE POISONING CASE IN FRANCE.


    THE trial of Pel on the double charge of poisoning his first wife – his

    second is still living – and a servant who was also his mistress, has

    resulted in a verdict of guilty against the prisoner on the second

    count, although the jury were unable to make up their minds to convict

    him on the first, notwithstanding the declared presence of arsenic in

    the exhumed remains of his wife. Although these were the only two

    charges preferred against Pel, he is also suspected of having poisoned

    his mother as long ago as 1872, and of having attempted the lives, in a

    similar manner, of an old woman named Marie Mahoin and a girl named

    Eugénie Meyer, both of whom were at different times in Pel’s service.

    The girl Meyer, indeed, who frequently suffered from severe vomiting

    while she was in Pel’s service, has never been seen since Pel announced

    that she had left him, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor

    during the trial that Pel had poisoned her and disposed of the body, as

    he is believed to have disposed of that of Elise Boehmer, his servant

    and mistress, whose case, therefore, is almost parallel with that of

    Eugénie Meyer. It must be said that Pel’s explanation as to what had

    become of the missing women, and the cause of death of his mother and

    first wife, were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him

    was almost entirely circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a

    verdict of guilty was entered. There has, however, already been much

    comment on the fact that the prisoner was practically acquitted of the

    charge against his wife, whose remains were found to contain poison, and

    convicted of a charge of which absolutely no trace exists, save some

    cinders from the stove in which the victim’s body is supposed to have

    been burnt, and which are assumed to be all that remains of her

    incinerated corpse. M. Henri Rochefort, in the Intransigent, says that

    the verdict against Pel is the first instance of a man being found

    guilty of murder for poison when neither the poison nor the victim’s

    body has been found. La France calls attention to the fact that the jury

    gave a negative answer in the case of Pel’s first wife, in whose remains

    distinct traces of arsenic were discovered, and an affirmative answer in

    the indictment against the prisoner for the murder of Elise Boehmer,

    although in the latter case the accusation was only supported by medical

    conjecture. La France also calls attention to the lamentable defence

    that was made on the prisoner’s behalf. The Figaro thanks the jury for

    having resolutely saved society from the possible repetition of similar

    crimes by bringing in a verdict of guilty. Pel had been removed to be

    condemned cell at La Roquette prison. Since his conviction Pel has

    displayed more emotion and continues to earnestly declare his innocence.

    Pell has been sentenced to death.'

    Street Police-court, five men named James Palmer, Samuel Scandland, Leon Weiner,
    Adolphe Weiner, and Daniel Jacoby, have been charged with being concerned with
    a man already convicted named Dasant, with attempting to murder Jules Tabak, a
    diamond merchant, and stealing £2000 worth of diamonds. Inspector Langrish deposed
    that from information received he went with other officers and arrested the accused
    on the present charge. Mr. Taliak, a diamond merchant, of 5 Belgrave-street, Euston-road,
    deposed that on March 2, he had two men come to his house, and asked him to show
    them some diamonds. Two parcels were shown them, while the men were looking at
    the diamonds, the prisoner Palmer struck witnesses with two heavy blows on the
    head. He was stunned, the two men ran away, and stole one hundred and eighty carats
    of diamonds, valued at £14,100. One of the men Doeant was arrested, and has since
    been convicted and sentenced to penal servitude. He positively identified Palmer
    as the other man. Mr. Tabak was called, and identified Palmer as one of the men
    concerned in the robbery. She did not identify him at first. Eleanor Denunzio,
    the daughter of the man Dusant, deposed that on March 25th, the day of the robbery,
    the prisoner Palmer called on her and beckoned her to the corner of the street.
    He asked for her father. He said, "I struck the old man. He screamed, and his
    wife came upstairs and we were obliged to run away." She asked if the servant
    was stopped. Prisoner replied in the negative. She asked if her father had got
    away. Prisoner replied, "No," and told her she had better pack up her luggage
    and leave her house at once, and leave her luggage in the cloakroom. He said,
    "You know where Weiner lives, You must not go down to him and tell him to assist
    you." Witness packed up her luggage and took it to Waterloo Station, and afterwards
    went to Adolphe Weiner''s house, She packed the luggage and sent it to Waterloo
    Station the same day. She then went to C Dyers Buildings, and saw Adolphe Weiner.
    Directly he saw her, he said, "For God''s sake go away; I will meet you in Chancery-lane."
    She went there, where he shortly joined her, and took her to a room shop in Chancery-lane.
    Witness said, "You have got my father into this trouble, and I shall expect you
    to get him out of it." He denied at first that he knew anything about it. She
    told him that her father had told her about the affair from the beginning. He
    said that all he did was to get her father a situation. She said she knew that
    was false, and that he sent her father to Mr. Tabak. First, he said he would not
    assist her at all, and then he gave her 5s3., and said he would give her that
    every week until she got employment. He said whatever she did must not come near
    Dyers Buildings, because they were watched. Then she went to Jacoby''s house,
    but he was not at home. She saw him however, on the following Friday at his place
    in the Edgware road. He said he didn''t know they were going to strike him. Witness
    told him that he must take the money for her father''s maintenance in the House
    of Detention. He promised to do so, and met with her between the hours of 8pm
    and midnight in Avenue-court, Chelsea. She gave him £10 3s. for her father. On
    the following Monday she was to meet Weiner again, who promised to give her £2
    12s. for the rent then due by her father. Weiner did not turn up, but subsequently
    he saw Jacoby, who had £20 to pay the rent. He told her not to go to Natheir''s
    place at all. He promised to meet her at the Bull and Mouth Arch the following
    Wednesday day, but by the illness of Pearce and his wife she did not go. On March
    15th, after 8pm, Palmerner, she waited at the house of her mother-in-law. He came
    in and sent for his wife. They took witness to their house, and sent for her luggage

    rent to be paid at the rate of £11 to a month, the piano to become her property
    if she kept it in good condition. After six months, three installments fell into
    arrears, but in April, when they were served with a notice that the rent was due,
    she paid £50, immediately. However, soon after she vacated the premises, about
    two months later, she failed to pay any more rent. The court then discovered that
    Mr. Carter was her landlord, and he claimed for rent, costs, and Mrs. Neal undertook
    to pay or forfeit the piano. A writ of reavd ever to Ms. Neal was received. However,
    she had no money in her hour, so she hired LiJEd. The cost of this was £66i. was

  typed_text: 'THE HIRE SYSTEM.


    AT the Shoreditch County Court the case of Dyer and Son v. Mrs. Neal and

    Mr. S. Carter has been tried by Judge Prentice. The plaintiffs are

    pianoforte manufacturers, of 14 Stoke Newington-road, and they claimed

    of Mrs. Neal, who is a laundress, and Mr. Carter, an oilman, the sum of

    £23 2s., the value of a piano detained, and £22s, damages for the

    defendants having converted the instrument to their own use. Mr. Palmor

    appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Davis was counsel for the

    defendants. The plaintiffs'' case was that in December, 1884, Mrs. Neal

    had a piano of them upon the hire system. The cost of the instrument was

    £23 2s., and £22s, was paid at once, and the remainder was to be paid at

    the rate of £1 1s. a month, the piano to become her property if she paid

    all the instalments. After paying three instalments she got into

    arrears, but in August last, when £6 6s was due, she paid £8 10s.,

    making £13 15s, paid altogether. Soon after that she moved away, and it

    was about two months before she was found. It was then discovered that

    the defendant Carter, who was her landlord, had taken the piano in pawn

    for rent. The sum of £4 10s, was due for rent, and Mrs. Neal under took

    to per £46 in six months or forfeit the piano, Cross-examined: The

    agreement was read over to Mrs. Neal -fore she signed it. His Honour:

    Why did she pay £8 10s, when only £6 6s, was due? The # said it was of

    her own free will, His Honour: People do not usually pay more than is

    due. In answer to further questions, it was admitted for plaintiffs that

    they were told they could hare the piano if they paid £6, the amount of

    the indebtedness of Mrs. Neal to Mr. Carter, but they refused to do

    that. They were also offered the balance due on the agreement for the

    piano, but they refused to accept it. His Honour, in the result, said he

    must hold that the agreement was good, but be would assist the

    defendants as much as he could. The plaintiffs acted very improperly in

    not accepting the balance due under the agreement when it was rendered.

    He was very sorry that he must give a verdict in their favour, but he

    should only allow 1s damages, £9 7s. the balance of the £23 2s. and £2

    9s, 10d. the costs of the court. Had the £9 7s. held paid into court he

    would have given judgment for the defendants.'

    an extraordinary and apparently deliberate attempt to murder a woman, the wife
    of a house and estate agent named Tomlinson, of 7, Champion-terrace, Stamford
    Hill, took place in the public thoroughfare, about one hundred yards distance
    from her residence. She left home at twenty minutes past nine for the purpose
    of making a few purchases, and was almost immediately accosted by a man from behind.
    She turned round at once, and found that it was her sister''s husband, William
    Eiworthy. He walked by her side for a second or two, and then suddenly fired a
    pistol at the back of her head. She screamed. "I am shot!" and fell to the ground
    insensible. A girl living on the spot ran across the road and recognized Mrs.
    Tomlinson as she lay bleeding on the pavement. Being Saturday night, there were
    many people about. A crowd soon assembled, and the injured woman having been carried
    into her own house, Dr. Duncan, of Amherst Park, was sent for. He soon arrived,
    and found her suffering from a bullet wound behind the right ear, but the bullet
    had not penetrated the skull, having bounded off after striking the bone. Search
    was subsequently made for the bullet, but it could not be found. After the woman
    fell Esworthy hurried to the opposite side of the street, and threw something
    over a fence. He had been seen to fire the pistol by some passersby, and was seized
    by several men, who took him towards the Stoke Newington Police-station. They
    were met, however, by Sergeant Collins, of the N Division, to whom they reported
    the circumstances of the case, and gave the man into his custody. Collins, accompanied
    by a great many persons, conveyed Esworthy to the Tottenham Police-station. There
    he was charged with shooting and wounding with intent to murder one Harriet Tomlinson,
    at the High-road, Stamford Hill. In the parish of Tottenham. He gave the name
    of William Esworthy, aged twenty-eight, address 29, South-street, Manchester-square;
    business, commission agent. On the charge being read over to him he remarked,
    ''She did it herself, and I took the revolver away from her, and threw it over
    a fence on the opposite side of the road.'' On being searched a few coins and
    a cleaning-rod of a pistol were found upon him, but no ammunition. The prisoner
    having been locked up, Inspector Ashwell and Sergeant Collins proceeded to the
    spot indicated by him to search for the revolver; but, after a close inspection
    for an hour or so, they had not succeeded in finding it. The search then discontinued;
    it was resumed on Sunday morning at daylight by Sergeant Collins, and at a quarter-past
    five o''clock he discovered the revolver in a builder''s yard, almost opposite
    where the crime was committed. It is a weapon with seven chambers, six of which
    were loaded when it was picked up. It was, therefore, fully charged when the attack
    was made upon Mrs. Tomlinson. In investigating the matter on Sunday, the police
    ascertained that the prisoner spent nearly the whole of Saturday afternoon and
    evening watching the playing of cricket on some vacant land at the rear of Champion-terrace.
    After the match was over he was seen to pass Tomlinson''s place of business and
    go to a public-house, where he had some whisky. He then repassed the shop, and
    evidently waited about in the expectation that Mrs. Tomlinson would come out,
    as she eventually did, to make Saturday night''s purchases. As to the motive for
    the outrage, it is stated that there had been serious disagreements between the
    prisoner and his wife, and that Mrs. Tomlinson had supported her sister''s cause,
    and invited her to come to Stamford Hill and stay there on several occasions,
    which she had done. Mrs. Tomlinson, is the mother of two children, and is much
    respected by her neighbours, who express great sympathy towards her in her suffering,
    and make anxious inquiries as to her condition. It is clear that she had a miraculous
    escape from death. As it is, she is badly wounded, and her system has received
    a very severe shock, but there is scarcely any fear of her ultimate recovery.
    On Sunday evening the symptoms were highly favourable to that view. As may be
    imagined, the affair, happening in a crowded thoroughfare at a busy time on Saturday
    night, created intense excitement. Prisoner will be taken before the magistrates
    at Edmonton in a day or two."'

    some whisky. He then repassed the shop, and evidently waited about in

    the expectation that Mrs. Tomlinson would come out, as she eventually

    did, to make Saturday night''s purchases. As to the motive for the

    outrage, it is stated that there had been serious disagreements between

    the prisoner and his wife, and that Mrs. Tomlinson had supported her

    sister''s cause, and invited her to come to Stamford Hill and stay there

    on several occasions, which she had done. Mrs. Tomlinson, is the mother

    of two children, and is much respected by her neighbours, who express

    great sympathy towards her in her suffering, and make anxious inquiries

    as to her condition. It is clear that she had a miraculous escape from

    death. As it is she is badly wounded, and her system has received a very

    severe shock, but there is scarcely any fear of her ultimate recovery.

    On Sunday evening the symptoms were highly favourable to that view. Ae

    may be imagined, the affair, happening in a crowded thoroughfare at a

    busy time on Saturday night, created intense excitement. Prisoner will

    be taken before the magistrates at Edmonton in a day or two.'

    they sent someone from your headquarters? Captain Reynolds: They have not had
    time, sir. We all had to be here at ten o''clock this morning. MIr. Safford: The
    prisoners were admitted to bail between four and five o''clock on Sunday afternoon.
    Mr. Sheil: What time do you ask for? Mr. Parsons an officer from the Salvation
    Army headquarters : I appear on behalf of Messrs. Burton, Matthews, and Ranger,
    solicitors for the Salvation Army, to ask for a remand for three or four days
    for the purpose of instructing counsel. Mr. Sheil : I shall do nothing of the
    sort ; it is a ridiculous request. I will remand them until tomorrow, if you like.
    Mr. Parsons; Make it two days, your worship. Inspector Doogan: There are several
    gentlemen here as witnesses for the police who cannot very well come on another
    day. Mr. Sheil: Very well, I will go on with the case now. Mr. Parsons still pressed
    for a remand. Mr. Sheil : Very well; I will remand them, on the same bail as before.
    A Police Witness : But, your worship, I have already been kept here since eleven
    o''clock this morning. MIr. Sheil : I can''t help it. If I do not give them time
    to obtain counsel it will be a great grievance. I will remand the prisoners to
    any day that will suit the witnesses. Mr. Superintendent Shepherd : The whole
    of the prisoners have been on bail since Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sheil: I will go

    and Musical Agency" mean, then? Defendant: That is my brother, Edward

    Macdermott. Mr. Armstrong: Don''t you know that the usual commission is

    ten percent.? Defendant: Not with a man of my reputation. Big turns like

    myself pay five per cent. His honour remarked that where a man put his

    hand to a certain document, and that document was brought into court, he

    could not go away from it. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for the

    amount claimed. The defendant offered to hand over his cheque for £24

    1s. 8d. Mr. Armstrong: We would rather not take his cheque, sir.

    Defendant (excitedly): He has borrowed money of me and my family. I have

    been brought here to be insulted. Mr. Didcott: He has said he is not an

    agent. I shall be able to prove right up to the hilt that he is an

    agent. The parties then left the court.'

    Respectable-looking Little Girl, aged Thirteen, of Obhaldeqtone-road, Stoke Newington,
    was charged before Mr. Brose, at Dilston Police-court, on Monday, with pocket-picking
    at the Preaching-road Congregational Church on Sunday night. A gentleman named
    Fiaming Williams, minister of the church, said that recently a great number of
    purses had been stolen from members of his congregation. On the day in question
    he noticed the little child moving suspiciously about amongst the women of the
    church, and he mentioned it to his deacon, Mr. D. A. Remain who defended: Never
    mind what you told your deacons. The Magistrate: What did you do yourself with
    regard to the arrest? Mr. Fiaming Williams : She was taken into custody and charged
    by me as responsible officer of the church. Mr. Jemeni Branch, hoot manufacturer,
    a member of the London County Council, and a deacon of the church in question,
    said that from the description he had from his minister, he watched this child
    in church on Sunday evening. She was sitting in one of the pews, and from what
    he saw he felt impressed that she was- Mr. Remain: Never mind your impressions.
    Witness continuing said that at the close of the service the child sat in the
    seat some time after she might have gone, subsequently stood at the end of the
    pew, and then mixed with ladies as they came down the aisle. Witness followed
    behind, and saw her moving her hands in a very suspicious manner amongst the ladies''
    dresses. Witness followed her to the church porch, and then thought it best to
    take her. He noticed that she had her gloves on during the service, but now she
    had the glove off her right hand. Witness took the child back to a pew, and noticing
    her moving her hands he asked one of his colleagues to see if anything had dropped
    upon the floor. They found a crimson plush purse containing a flare and a penny,
    at her feet, and she said this belonged to her and confessed a penny. Witness
    subsequently asked her when she began to do this, and she said that a servant
    that she had met on the beach at Herne Bay had taught her how to do it. Cross-examined:
    He would most certainly have charged the child from what he saw, even if he had
    not found the purse. He had never seen the child do anything of the kind before.
    He did not give the child into custody on suspicion, because he knew that she
    did it. Mr. George Collier, commercial traveller, also a deacon at Rectory-road,
    said: When the child was taken into the vestry I took hold of the dear little
    thing by the hand and asked her to sit down on the sofa. She said she lived at
    home with her father and step-mother. She could not remember her mother. I said,
    Now, my dear little child, tell me why you have done this. She replied, I have
    not done it. I said, Now, tell me, and we will befriend you. Mr. Brose: I am not
    sure I can take any more of your evidence. There is an inducement for her to make
    a confession, which is not evidence. Mr. Henry Fitzhenry, another commercial traveller,
    and deacon of the church in question, said that he recognized the child as one
    of whom the pastor spoke on the previous Sunday with regard to lost purses. He
    followed Mr. Branch, and saw the child moving her hands in a very suspicious manner
    amongst ladies'' dresses. He generally corroborated the other witnesses. By Mr.
    Remain: Unless I had been set to watch possibly I might not have been suspicious
    of her. Mr. Henry Perkins deposed that the child, when charged, gave a correct
    address, and from inquiries he made he was of opinion that the child''s parents
    were respectable. Mr. Brose On this evidence I shall remand the girl In custody
    for a week. Mr. Remain asked permission to call the child''s father, with a view
    of giving bail for the accused. Mr. Brose: If you can prove to me that the purse
    belongs to the child I might entertain your application. Mr. Remain: I can prove
    she is a quiet, well-behaved child, who has a money-box and saves most that she
    gets. The father of the child was only asked as to her age, when he replied thirteen."'

    ALLEGED INGENIOUS FRAUDS.


    AT the Bilston Police-court, on Friday, John Herbert Brown, thirty-two,

    a bookbinder by trade, but who had conferred upon himself the title of

    Dr. G. H. Adamson, of Park House, Leeds, was committed for trial on six

    different charges of fraud. The circumstances, although almost the same

    in each case, were of a most extraordinary character. The prisoner, it

    appears, adopted the plan of first making himself acquainted with

    persona resident in Bilston, West Bromwich, and other parts of the

    district who had relatives in Australia; he then waited upon them, and,

    stating that he had just come over from the colony on a short visit,

    said he was entrusted with friendly inquiries from their absent

    relatives. By this means it is alleged he managed to obtain quantities

    of valuable articles in the form of jewellery and trinkets, which he

    promised to convey on his return to Australia to the individuals for

    whom they were intended. At West Bromwich, it seems, he slightly altered

    his tactics. Having obtained from a Mrs. Willis, wife of a grocer, a

    number of small articles as presents to her married daughter, he went

    straightway to another West Bromwich grocer named Hodgetts, and handed

    over the articles he had obtained from Mrs. Willis as presents from

    their absent brother, who was about to be married. The hair quickly

    took, and prisoner was made the happy recipient of a gold albert guard

    and silver Jubilees brooch and other valuables as presents for the

    intending bride and bridegroom, and intrinsically worth about three

    times the articles he had given in exchange Prisoner offered no defence,

    and he was committed for trial.'
- handwritten_text_corrected: '"SEQUEL TO A MIDNIGHT AFFRAY. IN the Lord Mayor''s
    Court, on Friday, the Assistant Judge Mr. Rixburgb and a jury had before them
    the cases of Spicer v. Agate and Agate v. Spicer, let consolidated. The plaintiff
    in the first case, a housekeeper employed at 399, New Broad-street, sued the defendant,
    a bank messenger, to recover £G corn-an pensation for an assault committed upon
    him by the defendant. Mr. Watien was counsel for Spicer, and Mr. C. A. Rouse-ell
    for the defendant. It appeared that Spicer met a man named Haycoek at an Odd-fellows
    meeting, and in a conversation which ensued, Spicer told Haycoek that the defendant
    was leaving his situation. In consequence of that, Haycock applied with to the
    bank for his post. Agate was very much troubled by this, and called upon Haycook
    and asked him what he meant. Haycock related the circumstances, and after the
    two had had a friendly drink together, Agate, at half-past eleven at night, went
    to Spicers house. Spicer was in bed, and according to his evidence, Agate rang
    the bell violently, kicked at the door, and made such a hubbub that he Spicer
    thought, there must be a fire, and he accordingly awakened his wife and daughters.
    As who all prepared to leave the house in their night gear. Spicer ran down hurriedly
    to the door, where he was confronted by Agate, who demanded to know what he meant,

    IN the Lord Mayor’s Court, on Friday, the Assistant Judge (Mr. Roxburgh)

    and a jury had before them the cases of Spicer v. Agate and Agate v.

    employed at 39, New Broad-street, sued the defendant, a bank messenger,

    to recover £6 compensation for an assault committed upon him by the

    defendant. Mr. Watson was counsel for Spicer, and Mr. C. A. Russell for

    the defendant. It appeared that Spicer met a man named Haycock at

    an Odd-fellows’ meeting, and in a conversation which ensued Spicer told

    Haycock that the defendant was leaving his situation. In consequence of

    that Haycock applied to the bank for his post. Agate was very much

    incensed at this, and called upon Haycock and asked him “what he meant.”

    Haycock related the circumstances, and after the two had had a “friendly

    glass” together, Agate, at half-past eleven at night, called at Spicer’s

    house. Spicer was in bed, and according to his evidence Agate rang the

    bell violently, kicked at the door, and made such a hubbub that he

    (Spicer) thought there must be a fire, and he accordingly awakened his

    wife and daughters, who all prepared to leave the house in their night

    Agate, who demanded to know “what he meant,” and threatened to “knock

    SINCE Wright, the Hoxton burglar, received his flogging for the

    murderous attack on Warder Attwood, he has been kept in solitary

    confinement. His demeanor is sullen and his mania for destruction is as

    keen as when he was first incarcerated. Of course, at present there is

    not the slightest possibility of his doing further injury to his

    guardians, but he vows when the opportunity presents itself he will have

    revenge for what he considers the ill-treatment he was subjected to some

    few weeks since. He maintains he will sacrifice the life of one of his

    keepers, so as to cheat the punishment meted out to him, preferring to

    meet his doom on the gallows than suffer penal servitude. No one is

    allowed to come in close contact with him, so that until he once more

    makes his appearance on the public works there is not the slightest need

    for alarm. His daily subsistence is handed him through iron bars, when

    periodical visits are made to his cell, and it is stated his language is

    most violent. It is also stated that he will be kept in solitary

    confinement for nine months, in the hope of taming-him, and at the

    expiration of that period will be permitted to labour on the public

    works with a gang of men. If by good conduct be should gain favour with

    the officials, he might be permitted to work without his chains.

    AT the County Magistrates Court, Liverpool, on Saturday, James Fecit,

    contractor for the supply of milk to the Walton Workhouse, was charged

    with selling milk not of the quality demanded by the purchaser. He had

    to supply 170 gallons daily, and on some samples being taken and tested

    it was found that the milk had been deprived of half its cream, and that

    waster had been added to the poorest milk to the extent of 10 per cent.

    The defendant was fined £20 and costs.

- handwritten_text_corrected: '"THE IAMPSTEAD MURDER. - SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION. At
    the Marylebone Police-court, on Tuesday, Eleanor Wheeler, otherwise Pearcey, was
    brought up before Mr Cooke on remand charged with the murder of Mrs. Phoebe Hogg
    and her infant daughter on the 24th of last month at Hampstead. There was again
    a large crowd outside the building, and great anxiety was shown to gain admission
    to the court. The prisoner was brought down in the prison van from Holloway. Detective
    Edward Parsons gave evidence as to the examination of the bloodstains in the dining
    kitchen. The other officers who were with him left, and he was for a time in the
    front room with the prisoner at 2, Priory-road. She said, "I have not told a lie.
    I have not been asked a question. Mrs. Hogg did come here at six o''clock, and
    asked me to lend her two shillings and mind the child. I told her I could not
    lend her the money as I had none, and I could not mind the child as I was going
    out. I told Clara Hogg about it, and she advised me to say nothing about it, as
    it would be such a disgrace if people thought her husband kept her short of it
    money." Afterwards the prisoner said, "I do not enjoy very good health. On Thursday
    night then I came home my nose bled violently. On the 31st of October he handed
    over to Dr. Pepptr certain articles found in the prisoner''s room. Ellen Barrand,
    of 141, Prince of Wales-road, said she was the landlady of the house. She knew
    the prisoner, and had gone backwards and forwards to her house, where Mr. and
    Mrs. Hogg had lived. A fortnight before the murder she saw the prisoner ring the
    first-floor bell. Mrs. Hogg''s mother was out, and the deceased woman came down
    and opened by the door. Mrs. Hogg and the prisoner stood talking for a few moments,
    after which they both went upstairs. The prisoner remained there a short time.
    Either on the Thursday or Friday before the murder she heard the door-bell ring,
    and a boy go away from the door after speaking to someone. Charles Britt, a carman,
    having stables in Priory-row mews, said that he was going through Priory-street
    on the afternoon of October 24th, when he saw a woman with a perambulator knock
    at the door of the first house No. 2. The door was opened by a woman, but he could
    not say whether it was the prisoner. Mr. Hogg was recalled and asked a number
    of questions - as to where he was working on the day of the murder, and his statements
    substantially bore out the evidence previously given by him. Mr. Bond, of Westminster
    Hospital, repeated the medical testimony given by him for at the inquest. He said
    there was no blood in the passage or front room. The floor of the kitchen had
    the appearance of having been cleaned. He examined prisoners'' hands at Kentish-town
    Police-station after her arrest, and found several superficial scratches and abrasions
    which had been recently inflicted. Some of the hairs found in the prisoner''s
    kitchen corresponded with those of the deceased woman. The severing of the head
    would enable it to be doubled either under or above the body, and thus the body
    could be more easily placed in the bassinette. He could not say whether or not
    the stains in the kitchen were human blood. Professor Pepper was the next witness
    called. He deposed that he had made a post-mortem examination of the deceased
    woman and her infant child. He believed Mrs. Hogg''s throat was cut while the
    heart was beating. The child had died either from suffocation or exposure. He
    had made an autopsy of thirty-five articles found in the prisoner''s rooms. A
    great number of them were stained with blood. The prisoner, who said she would
    reserve her defence, was committed for trial. The Recorder, in charging the Grand
    Jury at the opening of the November sessions of the Central Criminal Court on
    Monday morning, said: Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, there have been one hundred
    prisoners added to the calendar since the last sitting of the Court; but that
    is not a large number considering the interval. I am sorry to see, however, that
    there are several cases wherein life has been lost under circumstances which justify
    charges of crime. Of these are charges of murder and two of manslaughter; in addition
    to which there are several charges of robbery with violence. The most serious
    case of all is that against a young woman named Mary Eleanor Pearcey, who stands
    charged with the double murder of a young woman and her baby. The young women''s
    name was Phoebe Hogg. It appears that the prisoner had been on terms of intimacy
    with the husband of the murdered woman for some years, and a long correspondence
    shows that she was devotedly attached to him, and had been cohabiting with him
    immorally for five years. About two years ago he was married to Phoebe Hogg, and
    had one child. At the time the offence was committed the mother and baby went
    by invitation of the prisoner to her house, and while there both were murdered
    - the woman first and afterwards her baby. The rooms showed many signs of a heinous
    crime having been committed. There was blood in different parts of two rooms,
    on a portion of the prisoner''s dress, and on two knives found in the table drawer
    in the kitchen, where the violence was obviously perpetrated. There are therefore
    overwhelming reasons why she should be put upon her trial and charged with this
    serious offence. The crime having been committed in the house, where there were
    other persons who do not appear to have heard anything which particularly attracted
    their attention, the body was taken for a mile without observation. After that
    the body of the baby was taken away and thrown into a field. The depositions are
    of great length, because everyone who saw anything material to the charge was
    called before the magistrate, but it will not be necessary that you go into these
    matters of detail. All that you are required to do is to see that there is such
    a prima facie case as will enable you to say that the prisoner ought to be put
    upon her trial."'

    and great anxiety was shown to gain admission to the court. The prisoner

    was brought down the prison van from Holloway. Detective Edward Parsons

    gave evidence as to the examination of the bloodstains in the kitchen.

    The other officers who were with him left, and he was for a time in the

    MR. TROUTBECK held an inquest, at St. George''s Hospital, with reference

    to the death of Charles Evans, twenty-two, an architect, of 18,

    Kensington-court-place, who committed suicide on the morning of the 5th

    inst. Dr. Joseph Arderne Ormerod, M.D., residing at 25, Upper

    Wimpole-street, W., identified the deceased as his nephew, and stated

    that he had heard he had been suffering from influenza. Mr. Herbert

    Campbell Moore, residing at 18, Kensington-court-place, said that he

    occupied chambers with the deceased, and had done so for the last seven

    months. They used the same bedroom. On Thursday night they both went to

    bed at ten minutes past twelve. The deceased seemed fairly cheerful, and

    witness noticed nothing the matter at the time. He had often seemed a

    little depressed, but had never threatened to commit suicide. Soon after

    two o''clock on Friday morning witness was awakened by the deceased

    jumping on him and shouting, "I am mad, mad!" at the same time tearing

    his nightdress to pieces. Witness carried him on to his bed, which was

    at the other side of the room, and held him down. Ten minutes or a

    quarter of an hour elapsed, and Evans seemed to get worse. He said to

    witness, "I shall have the strength of a madman in a few minutes. I do

    not want to hurt you, but I am afraid I shall." Soon after that the

    candle began to flicker and witness got up to light another. He had no

    sooner got up, however, than the deceased sprang upon him. Witness

    struck out at him and felled him to the ground, and they were struggling

    together on the ground for some time. Witness called to the man in the

    next suite of chambers for help, but he did not seem to hear. Finally,

    they got near the door in the struggle, and witness then managed to get

    on the top of his opponent, and held him by the throat till he became

    exhausted. Witness then ran from the room to Mr. Arnold, who occupied

    chambers downstairs, and knocked at his door. He waited there till Mr.

    Arnold came out, the deceased in the meantime having recovered, and,

    getting more excited, was running about the room, knocking the furniture

    about. They were about to enter the room together, when they heard a

    crash of breaking glass, and on getting inside they found nobody there.

    Search was made, and Evans was afterwards found lying stark naked in the

    timber yard below. By the Jury: They were quite sober when they went to

    bed. Mr. Reginald Arnold, an artist, who was called to the assistance of

    the last witness, said he was of opinion that the deceased had jumped on

    to the chest of drawers which was in the room, and then thrown himself

    through the window. The apartment was on the second floor and

    thirty-three feet from the ground. Mr. Cecil Berry, house surgeon, said

    that the deceased was much collapsed when admitted, and died within

    three hours, the cause of death being fracture of the spine. The body

    was much bruised and the forehead was cut. The coroner, in summing up,

    said it was clear that Mr. Moore and the deceased had had a terrible

    midnight struggle, and the jury returned a verdict of suicide during

    temporary insanity.'

    INHUMAN TREATMENT OF A CHILD. —Dr. Macdonald, coroner for North-east

    Middlesex, on Saturday had reported to him the death of William Watson,

    aged two months, the son of a carpenter, living at Morley Avenue, Wood

    Green. It appears that the mother of the deceased died soon after the

    child''s birth, and the baby was then put out to nurse. The father,

    however, neglected to pay the sum he had agreed to for the child''s

    support, and the nurse threatened that unless he did so she would leave

    the child at his house. This threat was carried into execution, and the

    poor little thing, it is said, was left by the father lying in the

    passage for three hours in the middle of the night. The Society for the

    Prevention of Cruelty to Children hearing of the case, called in Dr.

    Maclaclin, of Alexandra-road, but death took place shortly afterwards. A

    YOUNG THIEVES. —John Fitzgibbon, eighteen, and Albert Knight, seventeen,

    pleaded guilty, at the Middlesex County Sessions, to stealing 68Ib.

    weight of lead, value 10s., the property of George German, Willesden.

    The prisoners were seen on the night of January 13th in Kilburn,

    carrying a sack containing a sack containing lead, which was afterwards

    found to have been pulled down from some new buildings in the

    neighbourhood. Mr. Halkett prosecuted, and a previous conviction was

    proved against Knight. Detective Langford gave both the prisoners a bad

    character. They were continually hanging about the neighbourhood

    committing petty thefts, and when Knight was caught on the last occasion

    Fitzgibbon was with him, but escaped. Knight was sentenced to nine

    months'' hard labour, but Fitzgibbon, as a first offender, was remanded

    in order that Mr. Wheatley, of St. Giles''s Christian Mission, might be

- handwritten_text_corrected: '"TRIAL OF MRS. OSBORNE. PLEA OF GUILTY AND SENTENCE
    OF NINE MONTHS IARD LABOUR. The closing stage in the noted pearl stealing case
    was reached at the Central Criminal Court, on Wednesday, where Mrs. Osborne was
    formally indicted, before Justice Smith, for the theft of Mrs. Hargreaves'' jewels,
    and for wilful and corrupt perjury, in the libel action which she brought against
    Major and Mrs. Hargreaves. Among the early arrivals were Major and Mrs. Hargreaves,
    who were all seated at the solicitors table, and Mr. Benjamin, whose unexpected
    interposition in the libel action produced such startling results. The jury was
    sworn in a few minutes after ten. The counsel for the prosecution were Mr. Gill
    and Mr. Forrest Falton, while for the defence Sir Charles Russell, Mr. Coward,
    and Mr. C. Mathews were briefed. Captain Osborne arrived soon after ten, and was
    accommodated with a seat among the junior counsel. The learned judge and Lord
    Mayor entered the court at half-past ten.


    Mrs. Osborne in the Dock. Mrs. Osborne was at once brought into the dock. She
    was supported around the waist by a female warder, who helped her into a chair.
    She was immediately charged with the theft and the perjury, and in an inaudible
    voice pleaded guilty to both charges. Mr. Forrest Falton said he was instructed
    to prosecute on behalf of the Treasury, and would briefly narrate facts. Justice
    Smith: I have all the depositions before me, and therefore know the facts. Mrs.
    Hargreaves spoke: May I say, my lord- The Judge: I cannot hear you unless you
    are going to make an appeal for mercy. Mrs. Hargreaves: Indeed, I am, my lord,
    with all my heart. Sobbing.


    I have known her and loved her all her life, and am perfectly convinced she was
    not in her right mind when she took the jewels. The Judge then proceeded to pass
    sentence, the prisoner, who was crying bitterly, still remaining seated. He said,
    You stole the jewels of your friend. You converted them into money. You appropriated
    the money to your own use, and when suspicion pointed to you as being the actual
    thief you commenced an action in order to vindicate your character. In that action
    you falsely and corruptly swore to facts which were intended to lead the jury
    to believe you did not steal the jewels. I do not know what would have been the
    result had it not been for the interposition of one man, who was able to produce
    a document with your endorsement. But I am sure of one thing. If your wilful and
    corrupt perjury had succeeded, your friends Major and Mrs. Hargreaves would have
    left that court with the stain of indelible ignominy upon them. Fortunately it
    did not succeed. This is a serious matter. The maximum penalty for perjury is
    seven years penal servitude. I am not going to inflict that, but I do intend to
    give a severe punishment for one in your position. I know the jewels and the misappropriated
    money have been returned, and all the costs paid, and I bear that in mind. You
    have been some time in prison; you surrendered yourself to justice; your condition
    is known to me; and Mrs. Hargreaves, as well as your counsel, have appealed for
    mercy. The sentence is that you be imprisoned for nine months and put to such
    hard labour as the state of your health will permit.


    The closing scene. Prisoner was then carried from the dock sobbing bitterly, and
    apparently astounded at the sentence. Her husband and Mrs. Hargreaves were also
    deeply affected. With the sentence passed upon Mrs. Osborne on Wednesday, the
    curtain falls upon as pitiable a drama of real life as ever was presented to the
    public gaze. To comment now upon the unhappy lady''s offence and its punishment
    is needless. We need only say a last word of sympathy for her relatives, and,
    above all, for her husband, who has played the part of a gallant gentleman while
    overwhelmed by the most cruel blows of wholly undeserved misfortune. To one feature
    of the case we would, however, call attention. It was stated in the course of
    the trial that the Public Prosecutor had taken action in consequence of Mrs. Osbornes
    perjury alone; that, if there had been no other charge against her, his action
    would not have been taken. This sudden awakening of the official conscience to
    the wickedness of perjury is remarkable. Not that there is no need of increased
    activity in that matter. On the contrary, the judges have long been periodically
    deploring the terrible increase in the crime of false swearing. One of them even
    went so far as to say recently that he believed that in the majority of the cases
    he tried perjury was committed on one side or the other, and very frequently on
    both. So far, then, it is an excellent thing that the Public Prosecutor should
    have become alive to the existence of a grave public scandal. But we hope that
    the fact that it has required an extremely sensational case, involving persons
    in a high social position, to effect this awakening does not mean that the commonplace
    perjurers are to continue to go Scot free. Cases quite as flagrant, though not
    so sensational, are occurring day by day, and it is the obscure offenders who
    are never pounced upon by the Public Prosecutor, or only very rarely."'

    PLEA OF GUILTY.


    SENTENCE OF NINE MONTHS'' HARD LABOUR.


    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    THE closing stage in the noted pearl stealing case was reached, at the

    Central Criminal Court, on Wednesday morning, where Mrs. Osborne was

    formally indicted, before Justice Smith, for the theft of Mrs.

    Hargreaves’s jewels, and for wilful and corrupt perjury, in the libel

    action which she brought against Major and Mrs. Hargreaves. Among the

    early arrivals were Major and Mrs. Hargreaves, who were seated at the

    solicitors'' table, and Mr. Benjamin, whose unexpected interposition in

    the libel action produced such startling results. The jury were sworn in

    a few minutes after ten. The counsel for the prosecution were Mr. Gill

    and Mr. Forrest Fulton, while for the defence Sir Charles Russell, Mr.

    Coward, and Mr. C. Mathews were briefed. Captain Osborne arrived soon

    after ten, and was accommodated with a seat among the junior counsel.

    The learned judge and Lord Mayor entered the court at half-past ten.


    MRS. OSBORNE IN THE DOCK.


    Mrs. Osborne was at once brought into the dock. She was supported around

    the waist by a female warder, who helped her into a chair. She was at

    once charged with the theft and the perjury, and in an inaudible voice

    pleaded guilty to both charges. Mr. Forrest Fulton said he was

    instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Treasury, and would briefly

    narrate facts. Justice Smith: I have all the depositions before me, and

    therefore know the facts.


    MRS. HARGREAVES SPEAKS.


    Mrs. Hargreaves: May I say, my lord— The Judge: I cannot hear you unless

    you are going to make an appeal for mercy. Mrs. Hargreaves: Indeed, I

    am, my lord, with all my heart. (Sobbing.) I have known her and loved

    her all her life, and am perfectly convinced she was not in her right

    mind when she took the jewels.


    THE SENTENCE.


    Justice Smith then proceeded to pass sentence, the prisoner, who was

    crying bitterly, still remaining seated. He said, "You stole the jewels

    of your friend. You converted them into money. You appropriated the

    money to your own use, and when suspicion pointed to you as being the

    actual thief you commenced an action in order to vindicate your

    character. In that action you falsely and corruptly swore to facts which

    were intended to lead the jury to believe you did not steal the jewels.

    I do not know what would have been the result had it not been for the

    interposition of one man, who was able to produce a document with your

    endorsement. But I am sure of one thing. If your wilful and corrupt

    perjury had succeeded, your friends Major and Mrs. Hargreaves would have

    left that court with the stain of indelible ignominy upon them.

    Fortunately, it did not succeed. This is a serious matter. The maximum

    penalty for perjury is seven years'' penal servitude. I am not going to

    inflict that, but I do intend to give a severe punishment for one in

    your position. I know the jewels and the misappropriated money have been

    returned, and all the costs paid, and I bear that in mind. You have been

    some time in prison; you surrendered yourself to justice; your condition

    is known to me; and Mrs. Hargreaves, as well as your counsel, have

    appealed for mercy. The sentence is that you be imprisoned for nine

    months and put to such hard labour as the state of your health will

    permit.


    THE CLOSING SCENE.


    Prisoner was then carried from the dock sobbing bitterly, and apparently

    astounded at the sentence. Her husband and Mrs. Hargreaves were also

    deeply affected.


    With the sentence passed upon Mrs. Osborne on Wednesday the curtain

    falls upon as pitiable a drama of real life as ever was presented to the

    public gaze. To comment now upon the unhappy lady''s offence and its

    punishment is needless. We need only say a last word of sympathy for her

    relatives, and, above all, for her husband, who has played the part of a

    gallant gentleman while overwhelmed by the most cruel blows of wholly

    undeserved misfortune. To one feature of the case we would, however,

    call attention. It was stated in the course of the trial that the Public

    Prosecutor had taken action in consequence of Mrs. Osborne''s perjury

    alone; that, if there had been no other charge against her, his action

    would not have been taken. This sudden awakening of the official

    conscience to the wickedness of perjury is remarkable. Not that there is

    no need of increased activity in that matter. On the contrary, the

    judges have long been periodically deploring the terrible increase in

    the crime of false swearing. One of them even went so far as to say

    recently that he believed that in the majority of the cases he tried

    perjury was committed on one side or the other, and very frequently on

    both. So far, then, it is an excellent thing that the Public Prosecutor

    should have become alive to the existence of a grave public scandal. But

    we hope that the fact that it has required an extremely sensational

    case, involving persons in a high social position, to effect this

    awakening does not mean that the common place perjurers are to continue

    to go scot free. Cases quite as flagrant, though not so sensational, are

    occurring day by day, and the obscure offenders are never pounced upon

    by the Public Prosecutor, or only very rarely. Now however, we shall

    look forward to a new departure, and the equal punishment of all

    perjurers, high and low. We do not like any procedure that suggests that

    the law is not the same for all classes of the community, whether it be

    the rich or the poor who may suffer the most by such improper

    distinctions.


    Our artist has made some sketches of the prison life of the unfortunate

    woman. A prisoner has to be sorely tried and to put up with a number of

    indignities in prison especially those belonging to the better class,

    but Mrs. Osborne has erred in no small degree and she must pay the

    penalty of her misdeeds.'

    her own throat. The accused is a woman of fine physique, and preserved an attitude
    of stolid h . indifference throughout the proceedings. She spoke- T 5 once only,
    and that was while the doctors evidence p i was given.


    Grace Russell, housemaid in the employ a e of Mr. Heneman. wag first called. She
    deposed that on the 92nd of February her mistress was strange in her behaviour,
    and retired at seven o''clock in the r: evening. The next morning she woke at
    seven o''clock, M e and instructed the witness to dress master Harry in his besbsuit.
    Before the boy was completely dressed t 5 the accused took him down into the breakfast-room.
    Mr. Heosman was in bed at this time. Later the witness knocked at the breakfast-room
    door, and after a short delay the accused opened it, and the witness then saw
    the boy lying on the floor, face downwards, in a pool of blood. The accused called
    her into the room, and asked, "This comes of not telling the truth. Mind you always
    speak the truth." The accused then ordered witness to fetch Mr LHensman, and she
    complied, and when she returned e to the room she noticed that her mistress was
    bleeding from a wound on the throat. Dr. Goddard was called by the witness, and
    her master arrived at the doctor''s surgery immediately afterwards. They returned
    to The Lodge, and met the accused walking away from the house attired in her petticoat,
    slippers, a It and a sealskin jacket.


    In cross-examination by Mr. I H Humphreys the witness said that Mr. Hensman and
    his wife were always kind to the boy. They purchased a lot of new clothes for
    him at Christmas. The little boy asked why he was to put his best clothes on,
    and the accused replied, "We are going out." The witness had not of late noticed
    a wild look about it the accused.


    Dr. Charles Ernest Goddard said he was called to The Lodge, Alperton, by the last
    I y witness, and also by Mr. Hensman, on the morning ifof the 27th ult., and reached
    the house at about ;e twenty-five minutes to nine a.m. He found the accused outside
    the gate, partially dressed, and left her with her husband. He then entered the
    breakfast-room and found the boy Harry lying near the window. Life was extinct.
    The blood was warm. There were blood stains on the floor and an old bread-knife
    stained with blood was lying on the white table-cloth. An examination of the boy''s
    neck showed that the wound was a deep one, extending from two inches below the
    left ear, passing in a horizontal direction, and separating all the important
    structures of the neck down to the spinal column. There were two other superficial
    wounds on the boy''s face. Death was due to hemorrhage. The wounds on the accused
    were superficial. He had attended the accused since December, 1890, on and off.
    Nothing in her conduct gave him any reason to suspect that she was of unsound
    mind until the day before the occurrence, when she called at his surgery and asked
    whether he had heard that she was mad. She added that if her father committed
    suicide, and her mother was in an asylum, that was no reason why she should be
    mad too. It struck him that her mind was at breaking down, and he told her to
    inform her husband I se that he wished to see him. Mr. Hensman reached home late
    in the evening, and the next the witness heard was the summons to attend The Lodge.


    By him Mr. Humphreys: He was of opinion that she was suffering from homicidal
    mania at the time of the murder, and that she had lucid intervals. Police constable
    Blackmore, 139 X, proved the arrest of the accused. Inspector Cooper, X Division,
    produced l ce the table-knife, stained with blood, which he took so from the breakfast-room
    after the occurrence. He also read over the statement made by accused to the id
    effect that she was afraid the boy would be placed in a lunatic asylum and ill-treated.
    She added that she did it in a moment of frenzy, and was of a highly strung and

    smoke and the bed in flames. The fire was not extinguished till after

    the firemen had arrived, and they found the charred remains of the elder

    girl on the floor, while the baby, also dead, was lying in the bed. At

    the time Mrs. Rofe went out leaving her children there was a fire in the

    grate, with a guard in front. It is conjectured that the child Florence

    must have got out of bed to play with the light, and that, accidentally

    setting her night gown on fire, she rushed to the bed and ignited the

    bed clothes. The father of the deceased children, a barge beaker, was

    away at work at the time of the occurrence.

    A BRAVE MAN KILLED. —On Friday afternoon a sad accident happened to

    Henry Ambert, a labourer in the employ of the Kensal-green Gas Works. He

    was engaged on some repairs of the Gas Company just below the

    Brondesbury Bridge, crossing the London and North-Western Railway in

    Willesden-lane, when a horse attached to a heavily-laden cart belonging

    to Messrs. Bowyer, the contractors, took fright at the whistling of a

    locomotive and dashed down the incline at a great speed. Ambert rushed

    forward and endeavoured to check the horse by grasping the reins, but,

    missing his hold, fell under the wheels, which passed over his chest,

    crushing him dreadfully. The poor fellow was as speedily as possible

    removed to St. Mary’s Hospital, but life was extinct ere he arrived

    there.'

    HARRY AUGSTUS KRUSE, twenty-four, clerk, of Northwold-road, Upper

    Clapton, was before Mr. Haden Corser at North London Police-court, on

    Monday, on a charge of embezzling various sums of money collected by him

    on behalf of his employers Messrs. Matthew Rose and Sons, drapers, of

    Mare-street, Hackney. Mr. Samuels prosecuted, and Mr. Young defended.

    The evidence showed that the prisoner had been employed by Messrs. Rose

    as collector for twelve months prior to last September, when he

    absconded. Soon after that his receipt book was sent back, pointing out

    the sums which he had received and not paid in. Mr. Corser: What is the

    total amount of the defalcations? Mr. Young: The prosecutors have very

    generously agreed to proceed on one charge only, viz., £2 3s. 4d.,

    received from Mr. Llewellyo, of Coborn-road, Bow. Mr. Corser: What is the

    total amount? Mr. Young: £39, Mr. Mold, prosecutor’s cashier, said he

    had not received the various amounts which had been market by the

    accused. Mr. Corser: What wages had he? Mr. Rose: Thirty-five shillings

    a week. Mr. Young said the prisoner pleaded guilty, and expressed great

    sorrow; but he had given due notice to the prosecutors, so that there

    might recoup themselves from the Guarantee Society. Mr. Ross: Oh, don’t

    think for one moment that we are pressing the case because of the money

    not having been recovered. Detective-sergeant Whitlock, of the J

    Division, said he apprehended the prisoner at Tottenham on Saturday

    night, when the latter replied, to the reading of the warrant, “All

    the prisoner had been taken to a club of which he was not a member, and

    there induced to gamble. He took several small sums of his master’s

    money, and made notes of them in the hope of repaying them. But he

    became hopelessly involved, and sent back his books and absconded. Since

    had caused a good deal of public excitement, not only in the press but in the

    that Dr. Dyte had very suspiciously and illegally done what was expected of him
    at his time, but there were mitigating circumstances. In particular, the child
    died on March 18th, and at that time, Dr. Dyte was confined to his house suffering
    from the effects of a fall, and trusting to Mr. Smith, who was his unqualified
    assistant, he signed the certificate. Dr. Charles R. Drysdale, senior physician
    to the Metropolitan Free Hospital, said that Dr. Dytsb, who was a distinguished
    holder of gold medals of the London Hospital, Was one of the best known and most
    able of the Jewish doctors in London. Mr. Proctor said he saw no reason why the

    AT the North London Police-court, on Saturday, Dr. David Hyman Dyte, of

    43, Poole Park, Holloway, was summoned by Mr. Charles Townley for

    willfully making and issuing a false certificate concerning the death of

    Susannah Elizabeth Waller, aged seven months, of 100, Palmerston-road,

    in contravention of the provisions of the Births and Deaths Registration

    Act, 1874; and Henry Smyth, of the same address, was summoned for

    unlawfully using or sending the said certificate knowing it to be false.

    Mr. Lions, barrister, defended Dyte and pleaded guilty on his behalf;

    the other defendant pleaded not guilty. Mr. C. Townley, superintendent

    registrar of Islington, said this case had caused a good deal of public

    excitement, not only in the press but in the House of Commons. Dr. Dyte,

    it appeared, was a well-known medical practitioner, carrying on business

    in Derby-street, King’s-cross. He was also proprietor of a dispensary in

    Poole’s Park, Holloway, a very poor neighbourhood. As far as they could

    find out the only gentleman who attended there was Mr. Smyth. An

    extraordinary state of affairs existed at the dispensary. The patients

    were seen by a lady who prescribed for them and dispensed the medicines.

    A charge of 1s. was made, and when the patients got into a bad way Mr.

    Smyth appeared on the scene and a fee of 2s. or 2s. 6d was demanded. The

    inquiries showed that in four cases in which deaths had occurred Dyte

    had given certificates although he had never seen the child. Mr. Lions

    said that Dr. Dyte had very stupidly and illegally done what was charged

    against him, but there were mitigating circumstances. In this particular

    once the child died on March 18th, and at that time Dr. Dyte was

    confined to his house suffering from the effects of a fall, and trusting

    to Mr. Smyth, who was his unqualified assistant, and knowing the

    gentleman’s ability, he signed the certificate. Dr. Charles R. Drysdale,

    senior physician to the Metropolitan Free Hospital, said that Dr. Dyte,

    who was a distinguished student and gold medalist of the London

    Hospital, was one of the best known and most able of the Jewish doctors

    in London. Mr. Corser said he saw no reason why the penalty should be

    mitigated, and he consequently fined Dr. Dyte £10 or one month in

    default, and Smyth £5 or fourteen days in default, with costs amounting

    to £1 13s. 6d. in each case.'

    as could well be. If the man was simply resisting an attack upon him, he had nothing
    to do but to prove the fact, and he would at once have the sympathy of everyone.
    Mr. Burnie remarked that the evidence did not go to that extent. It would be hard
    as against the prisoner to say that the statement was absolutely without foundation,
    but he was precluded from proving it. The learned judge said he was not trying

- handwritten_text_corrected: '"I, - IN SEARCH OF, A MISSING BROTHER. This story was
    told in a prosecution at the London Sessions, held at Newington. It would appear
    that recently, WWfoie, has smiled upon Mr. William Ernest Prennless, Jobmaster,
    of Warmley, near Bristol; and remembering that in the days when he was not so
    well off he had a brother somewhere in London, he decided to journey to the metropolis
    and endeavor to find him. From a friend he heard his brother was a barman, and
    was employed at a public-house near the Round House, Vauxhall.


    Many a public-house bar did Mr. Prennless search, but all to no purpose. Tired
    and weary, the man entered a house near Vauxhall-cross, and the desire for companionship
    and a sympathizing friend induced Mr. Prennless to communicate the object of his
    visit to a stranger in the bar. Over many a glass did they mourn -the loss of
    the brother, and while Mr. P enlisted replenished the glasses, the stranger before-
    said begged to be excused for one minute. On his return a few moments later he
    offered to assist the Bristolian in a further investigation, when at that moment
    an individual entered. Mr. Prennless in the newcomer fancied he saw a fair resemblance
    in features to the long-lost brother. Presently Mr. Prennless was observed shaking
    the newcomer vigorously by the hand, and announcing him to the whole company as
    the long-forgotten relative; to celebrate such an auspicious occasion of course
    more corks were drawn.


    Subsequently, Mr. Prennless'' brother and his friend volunteered to see the opulent
    Bristolian to his hotel. The way seemed long -through a lot of dark courts and
    alleys, but he was surprised when he found himself suddenly thrown to the ground.
    His pockets were rifled of watch, chain, and money. The constable on the beat

    A SINGULAR story was told in a prosecution at the London Sessions held

    at Newington. Of late, it would appear, fortune has smiled upon Mr.

    William Ernest Rennless, jobmaster, of Warmley, near Bristol, and

    remembering that in the days when he was not so well off he had a

    brother “somewhere in London," he decided to journey to the metropolis

    and endeavour to find him. From a friend he heard his brother was a

    barman, and "was employed at a public-house near the Round House,

    Vauxhall.” Many a public-house bar did Mr. Rennless search, but all to

    no purpose. Tired and weary, the man entered a house near

    Vauxhall-cross, and the desire for companionship and a sympathizing

    friend induced Mr. Rennless to communicate the object of his visit to a

    stranger in the bar. Over many a glass did they mourn the loss of the

    brother, and whilst Mr. Rennless replenished the glasses the stranger

    aforesaid begged to be excused for one minute. On his return a few

    moments later he offered to assist the Bristolian in a further

    investigation, when at that moment un individual entered. Mr. Rennless

    in the newcomer fancied he saw a faint resemblance in features to the

    long-lost brother. Presently Mr. Rennless was observed shaking the

    newcomer vigorously by the hand, and announcing him to the whole company

    as the long-forgotten relative. To celebrate such an auspicious occasion

    of course more corks were drawn. Subsequently Mr. Rennless''s "brother”

    and his friend volunteered to see the opulent Bristolian to his hotel.

    The way seemed long—through a lot of dark courts and alleys, but his

    surprise gave way to downright astonishment when he found himself

    suddenly thrown to the ground and his pockets rifled of watch, chain,

    and money. The constable on the beat escorted him to the station, when

    Detective-sergeant Brogden was able to get from him a description of the

    assailants. Two men, named Glover (the long-lost “brother”) and

    Delourney, were arrested, and when before Mr. Rennless he seemed unable

    to identify them; but Sergeant'' Brogden, after the accused had been

    placed in the cells, arranged that the gaoler should look him in the

    10 StokeNewington, was charged before Sir JohnBridge, at Low-street, with fraud,
    indecent assault, and conspiracy. The specific allegations were that the prisoner
    conspired with Louis Leon Goldstein, otherwise Harry Roberts, to obtain by fraud
    £21 and other goods from Family Holton, in 1889 and 1890, and also indecently
    assaulting her. Mr. Lewis stated that he appeared to prosecute on behalf of Air.
    Labouchere, the proprietor of Truth. The prisoner was charged with Smith indecent
    assault and conspiracy with a man named Goldstein, alias Harry Roberts, to fleece
    servant girls of their money. On the 10th of December, in 1891, an article was
    published in Truth, called The Satanford-street, Road to Ruin, implicating the
    prisoner with carrying on all abominable trade in Staulford-street under the guise
    of a school for preparing girls for the stage and music-halls. Roberts brought
    an action for libel against Mr. Laboarchere, which was dismissed on the ground
    that the statements were true. Prisoner brought a criminal action, which was dismissed
    by the Lord Mayor, stating that the statements in 21 ab were true, and were published
    for the public benefit. Both men then absconded, and Goldstein has not since been
    discovered. Mr. Lewis trusted that the magistrate would be satisfied that the
    prisoner and Goldstein carried on a disgraceful trade, and that Mr. Labotichere
    had done a public service in bringing them to justice. Inspector Henry Marshall,
    of the E. Division, said he received warrants for the arrest of the prisoner and
    Goldstein on March 70th. He found that the house at 165, Stamford-street, which
    Goldstein had carried on business as Roberts, was shabby and that he had absconded.
    He also found that the prisoner had also left his lodgings and absconded. He was
    unable to trace him until that morning, when at half-past seven he found him at
    21, Newington-greenroad, Stoke New- ington. He saw him receive a letter from a
    postman at the door. He said to him, "I am Inspector Marshall and hold a warrant
    for your arrest." He said, "Yes." Witness entered a room in which he had been
    sleeping, and read the warrant to him in the presence of Sergeant Partridge. He
    said, "I deny having committed any fraud with Goldstein. I was simply his paid
    servant." Upon reading the warrant charging him with indecent assault, he said,
    "I deny having assaulted the girl." What about the action against Labouchere;
    you took an active part in that?" He said, "I was goaded on to that by Roberts
    and by a solicitor. I signed papers without reading them." Prisoner, who said

    she tightened round her neck. She must then have thrown herself out of the window.

    young girl, attired in nothing but a thin nightdress, dangling between

    the first and second storeys in front of the house. They

    immediately gave the alarm. The body was cut down in the presence of the father,

- handwritten_text_corrected: '"RXTINARY DEATH OF A POLICE CONSTABLE. _ Mathew Troutrouback,
    the coroner for Westminster, held an inquiry into the circumstances attending
    the death of Police-constable Joseph Daniels, aged 27 years, who was killed early
    on Sunday morning while taking a prisoner to Bowy-street Police station. Superintendent
    Stegglee, of the E division, was present. Joseph Daniels, a registration agent,
    of A 9, Evelyn House-Lane, Peckham, identified the victim deceased as his son,
    lately residing at Jubilee-buildings, Waterloo-road. Some time ago he had suffered
    several pelas in the face, and the divisional surgeon ordered him to have some
    of his teeth extracted and replaced by false ones. These he was wearing at the
    time of his death. Police-constable Alfred Smith, 379 Elm Street, said that on
    Sunday morning at about 12.20 he was in Kielle-street, Clare-market, taking a
    prisoner to Bow-street Police-station. A crowd of several hundred persons had
    assembled, and an attempt to rescue the man was made. Witness blew his whistle,
    and in response the deceased ran up. He took hold of the prisoner''s other arm,
    and they had only proceeded a few yards, when witness missed the deceased, and
    on looking round saw him lying on the pavement. Another constable came up, and
    witness went on his way. Police-official William ; Steward, 3b0 B, said that he
    was on duty in Newcastle-street, when he heard the whistle blow, and on going
    to Kednble-street, saw the two constables with a man in custody. Witness broke
    through the crowd, and then saw the deceased lying on the ground. He immediately

    MR. JOHN TROUTBECK, the coroner for Westminster, held an inquiry into

    morning while taking a prisoner to Bow-street Police-station.

    Superintendent Steggles, of the E division, was present. Joseph Daniels,

    a registration agent, of 9, Meeting-House-lane, Peckham, identified the

    deceased as his son, lately residing at Jubilee-buildings,

    Waterloo-road. Sometime ago he had erysipelas and the divisional surgeon

    ordered him to have some of his teeth extracted and replaced by false

    ones. These he was wearing at the time of his death. Police-constable

    Alfred Smith, 379 E, said that on Sunday morning at about 12.20 he was

    in Kemble-street, Clare-market, taking a prisoner to Bow-street

    Police-station. A crowd of several hundred persons had assembled, and an

    attempt to rescue the man was made. Witness blew his whistle, and in

    response the deceased came running up. He took hold of the prisoner’s

    other arm, and they had only proceeded a few yards, when witnessed

    missed the deceased, and on looking round saw him lying on the pavement.

    Another constable came up, and witness went on his way. Police-constable

    William Stewart, 350 E, said that he was on duty in New-castle-street,

    when he heard the whistle blow, and ongoing to Kemble street, saw the

    two constables with a man in custody. Witness broke through the crowd,

    and then saw the deceased lying on the ground. He immediately undid his

    collar and sent for an ambulance, on which he conveyed the unfortunate

    man to the hospital. By the Coroner: The deceased was not knocked down,

    kicked, or otherwise assaulted. Dr. Eric Law Pritchard house physician

    at King’s College Hospital, said that deceased was dead when admitted.

    INTENSE excitement was caused in Stood, a town adjoining the city of

    Rochester, early Friday morning by the report that a shoemaker named

    Frederick Marrs had nearly succeeded in murdering his wife and son, aged

    fifteen. It seems that Marrs attacked his wife with a hammer at three

    a.m. After receiving nine terrible wounds on her head she managed to

    escape into a neighbour''s house. The infuriated shoemaker then turned

    upon his son, who, by leaping from the top of the stairs to the bottom,

    managed to escape into the street and inform the police of what had

    and he was nearly dead when the constable in charge happened to look

    into his cell, saw the man''s condition, rushed in, and took the scarf

    off. The woman is in a dying condition, and her depositions were taken

    in the course of the day.


    Frederick Marrs, was brought before the magistrates at Strood, on

    Saturday, charged with feloniously wounding his wife at Strood with

    intent to murder her. The woman, who is lying in a very critical

    condition, was visited on Friday night by the magistrates, who took her

    depositions in the presence of the prisoner. The room in which the

    assault was committed was in a terrible condition. The furniture was

    smashed to pieces and the floor was saturated with blood.


    Mrs. Marrs stated that she was aroused from her sleep at three o''clock

    on Friday morning by her husband striking her on the head with a

    shoemaker''s hammer. She jumped out of bed and struggled to take the

    and closed, and one rib was fractured.


    The prisoner appeared to be in a dazed condition, and seemed to have

    little recollection of the terrible occurrence; and the magistrates,

    without going into the case, remanded him. It appears that Marrs married

    the woman about sixteen years ago, and that since then he has been idle

    and dissolute, his wife having to go out to work to keep him. Latterly

    down, and knew nothing of the accident until live o''clock the same afternoon.
    Dr. George Burroughs certified that death was due to an injury to the lungs, caused
    by a severe blow on the chest. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death,
    and requested the coroner to write to Mr. Covington and ask him to prevent boys

    the back. He was stopped by an inhabitant and detained until the police arrived,
    when he was taken into custody. Inspector Wilson stated that he examined the premises,

    r t Is it possible that the defeated party in Mid-lothian are to be ungenerous
    enough to worry Mr. Gladstone with another contest? A correspondent informs us
    that Colonel Wauchope has consented to contest Mr. Gladstone''s seat if he has
    to stand for re-election. The colonel refused to do this till it was pointed out
    to him that Mr. Gladstone''s remarks at Aberdeen, explaining the decrease of his
    majority, were virtually a challenge to another fight. Mr. Gladstone said that
    he had been deserted by many of his old supporters who oppose dis-establishment
    unless there is a preliminary appeal to the Scottish people. However, he indiscreetly
    claimed that his increased majority showed that those who hold this opinion must
    be in a minority in Midlothian. Many of them now say they supported Mr. Gladstone,
    as of old, on account of his Home Rule and on general grounds, not considering
    that the Church question was directly before the electors. As adherents of the
    Established Church, they complain that Mr. Gladstone is counting votes given to
    him on other grounds as votes given for dis-establishment. In this connection
    it may be of interest to recall the fact that about two years ago Midlothian was
    polled by circular on the disestablishment question, just as Edinburgh was when
    it was proposed to give Mr. Parnell the freedom of the city. In Scotland they
    are rather given to this method of testing local opinion on difficult points.
    Sixty percent. of the registered electors of Midlothian, in answer to the circular,
    said they were against dis-establishment. The Irish vote in Midlothian however,
    is about seven hundred-some say a thousand-strong. At its two remaining meetings

    the various schemes for which it is proposed to seek parliamentary powers in the
    next Session of the House of Commons. By one of the standing orders of the Council
    these schemes must be submitted before the end of July, in order to give the Parliamentary
    Committee due time for their preparation. The batch of proposals includes, four
    large public works of great importance to Londoners. There is, first, the scheme
    for the new thoroughfare from Holborn to the Strand, and the clearance of the
    Holywell-street block. The estimated cost of this will be just over £0,000,000.
    Secondly, there is the proposal for making a southern approach to the new Tower-bridge.

    on Inquiry Ml. S. F. L.trcHXAi,. coroner, held an inquiry at Marlborough Street
    St. Bartholomew''s Hospital with respect to the death of a man named John Reed,
    twenty-one, a meat-market porter, of Marsham Street, Blackfriars, who is alleged
    to have been stabbed by a boot and shoe maker named Robert Rosenkranz, in a shop
    in St. John''s Lane, Clerkenwell.


    Robert Somerville, a little boy, who was employed at Rosenkranz''s shop, deposed
    that he lived at 6, Rahere-street, Clerkenwell, and on the previous Saturday morning
    three men entered the shop. They picked up a pair of boots and were going to walk
    out with them when the accused stopped work and took the boots away. Reed, the
    deceased, added afterwards picked up a box of matches from the bench, and then
    taking up a chair, struck the accused on the back three times with it.


    The Coroner: What was that for? Did he say anything? The Witness: He did not say
    a word. I think the witness was then sent for the police, but the three men refused
    to let him leave the shop. At this time Rosenkranz had a shoemaker''s knife in
    his hand, and Reed fell on to the knife in a struggle with my master. Mr. Rosenkranz
    was cutting leather at the time, and he used the knife in self-defence.


    The Honorable Coroner: Who told you to say self-defence? The accused witness:
    I heard someone say so.


    Herbert Winfred, of 151, Great Saffron-hill, a butcher''s porter, stated that
    on Saturday morning he was standing outside 63,-St. John-street, and saw Reed
    fall against the shop. A witness went up to him, and found that he was bleeding
    from a wound in the chest. He turned to the witness, exclaiming, Oh, Sid, I have
    been stabbed! and added that the man in the shop then had done it.


    By the Coroner: I was not one of the three men who entered the shop, and know
    nothing about the occurrence. The boy, Somerville, recalled said he was certain
    that the witness was one of the men whom he saw in the shop. Winfred bursting
    into tears insisted that it was a falsehood. The Boy said his is not.


    Mr. Osborn, solicitor for the accused, cross-examined the Lee from the witness
    that he had been with Reed that morning. Police-constable Stevens deposed being
    called to the shop on the morning referred to: He found Reed lying outside it,
    bleeding from a wound in the chest, and at once bad him placed in a cab and conveyed
    to the hospital. Subsequently, on the door being opened, Winfred pointed to Rosenkranz,
    who was in the passage, and said, He is the man.


    The Mr. Oshorn: Winfred was then the worse for drink. Upon arresting the accused.
    Police-constable New 244 G stated that he asked the deceased when at the hospital

    deposed that he lived at 5, Rahere-street, Clerkenwell, and was employed

    at Rosenkranz''s shop. On Saturday morning three men entered the shop.

    They picked up a pair of boots, and were going to walk out of the shop

    with them when the accused stopped them and took the boots away. Reed,

    the deceased, afterwards picked up a box of matches from the bench, and

    then taking up a chair, struck the accused on the back three times with

    it. The Coroner: What was that for? Did he say anything? The Witness: He

    did not say a word. I was then sent for the police, but the three men

    refused to let me leave the shop. At this time Rosenkranz had a

    shoemaker''s knife in his hand, and the deceased ran against it. The

    man in the shop had done it. By the Coroner: I was not one of the three

    men who entered the shop, and know nothing further of the occurrence.

    The boy Somerville (recalled) said he was certain that the witness was

    one of the men whom he saw in the shop. Winfred It is a falsehood, The

    morning Police-constable Stevens deposed to being called to the shop on

    the morning referred to. He found Reed lying outside it, bleeding from a

    wound in the chest, and at once had him placed in a cab and conveyed to

    the hospital. Subsequently, on the door being opened, Winfred pointed to

    Rosenkranz, who was in the passage, and said, "He is the man." By Mr.

    Osborn: Winfred was then the worse for drink. He afterwards arrested the

    accused. Police-constable 244 G stated that he asked the deceased when
