    "ROBERY AT A BARONET''S. v EDWARD PRING, twenty-seven, capenter''s brush, was
    brought up on remand at the Greenwich Police-court, charged with stealing jewellery
    to the value of �100, the property of Sir Robert Cunliffe, Bart., 2, L1P., of
    37 Lot and street, Beigravia. Chief Inspector Phillips said there were a number
    of charges against the prisoner, all the robberies alleged being under similar
    circumstances. The prisoner was taken into custody, it appeared, on a charge of
    stealing a watch, and other articles, value �12, from the residence of Miss Kene,
    8 Belgrave-terrace, Lee. The prisoner called at the house and represented that
    he had been sent by the landlord to see to the blinds. He was given access to
    the bedrooms, and after he had gone, a watch, two rings, and two lockets were
    missed. His statement of having been sent to the house was found to be false.
    The prisoner was ultimately arrested on this charge, and he was subsequently charged
    with robery from Sir Robert Cunliffe upon information given by a young woman charged
    before the magistrate with the unlawful possession of a diamond ring. Robert Yfoellam,
    footman to Sir Robert, deposed that on March 28 the prisoner came to the house
    and said he had come to measure the blinds. Witness said new blinds were not required,
    whereupon the prisoner said he had been sent to put some new springs. He was permitted
    to go upstairs, and witness afterwards let him out at the Front door. The house
    was being painted. Sir Robert Cunliffe was sworn, and said a quantity of jewellery
    was missed on the evening of March 23 by Lady Cunliffe, with whom he had been
    out during the day. It was taken from the drawers in her dressing-table. He had
    since identified a pair of paste buckles, gold locket, emerald ring, two diamond
    rings, pair of crystal studs, Nor- mandy cross, single tast buckle, earbuncle
    locket, pair of earrings, and two eter rings. Other articles of jewellery and
    a purse containing �4 in gold and a �5 note were stolen. Jane Pring, mother of
    the prisoner, proved pledging several of the articles at her son''s request."

    at the Croydon petty sessions, Percy Davis, alias Gordon, a clerk, and Robert
    Everett, alias Davenport, two fashionably-attired young men, of 47 Auickland-road,
    Vauxhall, and Elizabeth Williams, described as a general servant, were charged
    on remand with being concerned together in stealing from the dwelling-house, 3
    Prior-terrace, St. Janet''s-road, Croydon, since October, 1881, to values amounting
    to about �50. Robert Everett, father of the prisoner of that name, was further
    charged with unlawfully pledging the same. The last-mentioned prisoner was for
    some years a superintendent in the Dorsetshire constabulary. Mr. Young, who appeared
    for the prosecution, said that his client, Mrs. Cosens, was an invalid lady eighty-two
    years of age and quite unable to attend the court owing to her infirmity. In September
    last she engaged the female prisoner as a confidential servant and attendant,
    and she was the only person who had access to the jewellery. Shortly after entering
    Mrs. Cosens'' service she formed the acquaintance of the prisoner Davis, and at
    the time, under the pretence of paying his addresses to the girl, he gained admission
    to the house and there was no doubt that he had made the place his home. He had
    evidently slept on the premises and enticed the girl to steal her mistress''s
    jewellery, which he took away and pledged, and spent the proceeds about the town.
    Everett shortly afterwards came upon the scene and carried out the same kind of
    proceeding. Emily Barlow, cook to the prosecutrix, stated that the prisoners first
    came to the house in civilian clothes, which they afterwards exchanged for their
    usual attire. They used to come up to breakfast time about half-past eleven o''clock
    in the morning, and helped themselves to dinner, the witness cooking the food
    purchased out of her mistress''s money. Davis was apparently courting Williams,
    and a servant named Smith, aged twenty-three, used to visit the house on evenings
    in the week and keep company with Everett. During the courtship she also slept
    in the house. Witness was not aware of the jewellery having been stolen. Detective
    Forster was then called to prove the arrest of the elder Everett. The accused
    said: ''My son gave me no notice, the things to pledge, as I was better known
    to get more money. He told me that the articles had been given to him by a relative.''
    These words were, I understand, uttered in a state of great excitement."'

    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    ABOUT noon on Friday information was received at the Rusholme

    Police-station that a woman had murdered her two children, aged three

    and five respectively, and then attempted to commit suicide by drowning.

    Upon the information being received Inspector Smith went at once with

    the person who gave the information to No. 54, Moss-side. On making a

    detailed examination of the premises he found the two children lying on

    a bed in one of the bedrooms naked and quite dead, apparently from

    drowning. Upon the body of one of the children there was a piece of

    paper containing some almost illegible writing. What portions of it that

    could be made out rang as follows :-- “Dear Papa, -- I could not stand

    it any longer . . . . to you. I do not think they are dead, for they . .

    . We shall never meet in heaven. I could not help it. I had a good

    husband.” The inspector took Mrs. Hibbert to the Rusholme

    Police-station, where she now lies. The full circumstances of the case

    appear to be as follows: -- The unfortunate woman is the wife of Thomas

    Hibbert, joiner and builder. About twelve months ago Mrs. Hibbert gave

    birth to a child. She fell ill, and finally became insane. She was

    removed to the Parkfield Asylum, near Macclesfield, of which institution

    she was an inmate up till the 3rd of this month. On that day her husband

    took her home, although warned that she was not perfectly sane, and that

    a strict watch would have to be kept over her actions. He proposed to

    hire a nurse, but Mrs. Hibbert appeared to be very much upset at such a

    notion being entertained that the idea was abandoned. On Friday morning

    he left for work as usual, leaving instructions for the servant to look

    after his wife. Shortly after his departure Mrs. Hibbert called the

    children upstairs to her, and was upstairs for about half an hour. She

    came down looking very ill. The servant became alarmed, and called in a

    neighbour. They went upstairs and heard a splashing in the bath. They

    went into the room and found Mrs. Hibbert in the bath. She then told

    them the two children were upstairs, but she did not think they were

    dead. She also told them she had been trying to drown herself. They at

    once went and gave information to the police.


    LATER DETAILS.


    Upon further inquiries being made, the following details were

    ascertained. About a year ago Mrs. Hibbert was confined of a child. The

    week following she fell ill, ultimately becoming insane, necessitating

    her removal to the Parkfield Asylum, Macclesfield. She was detained in

    that institution until Wednesday, when she was taken out by her husband.

    He was told she was not perfectly convalescent. He stated his intention

    of providing a nurse for her, but that seemed to excite Mrs. Hibbert to

    such an extent that the idea was reluctantly abandoned. Mrs. Hibbert

    rose about half-past seven on Friday morning and had breakfast with her

    husband. She then appeared to be in her usual health, bodily and

    mentally. Mr. Hibbert left the house about eight o’clock in order to

    proceed to his work, but prior to his doing so he gave strict orders to

    his servant to keep an eye upon her mistress’s movements. About nine

    o’clock Mrs. Hibbert told the servant to call the children in from

    playing in the front garden. Mrs. Hibbert took hold of the children and

    took them upstairs with her. She came down shortly afterwards and sent

    the servant for a bottle of soda, saying that she felt very unwell. On

    the servant’s return with the soda water, she asked her mistress what

    had become of the children. Mrs. Hibbert replied that they had gone to

    the corner shop. The servant went to inquire if they were there, but was

    told they had never been there. Becoming alarmed, she procured a

    neighbour named Mrs. Deedle to go back to the house with her, as she

    suspected something was the matter. On reaching the house they heard a

    splashing in the bathroom. They proceeded thither, and found Mrs.

    Hibbert in the bath. They asked her where the children were, and Mrs.

    Hibbert replied, “I have drowned them. I don’t think they are dead, as

    they are quite warm.” She took them into a bedroom where the two

    children were found lying quite naked on the bed, and although the

    bodies were warm they were perfectly dead. Mrs. Hibbert also told them

    she had been trying to drown herself in the bath for the last half hour.

    On receipt of this information Inspector smith went down to the house

    and made an examination of the premises. He found the two children lying

    dead on the bed. A piece of paper containing a few almost illegible

    sentences was laid on the body of the eldest child.'

    the prosecution was taken under 35 & 36 Victoria, chapter 76, of the Mines Regulation
    Act. With regard to the use of gunpowder, it was provided that it should only
    be used in cartridges, and not within three months after any inflammable gas had
    been found in the mine. The prosecution relied on this rule as it was clear that
    the regulatory requirements had not been complied with, it being requisite under
    the Act for some competent person duly appointed for that purpose to examine the
    place where the shot was to be fired immediately before the firing, and not to
    allow it to be discharged except it was safe to do so. It was also provided that
    persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be out of it or that part of it
    where the explosive was to be used. Mr. Cooper said he did not dispute that gas
    had been found, but it was not found within the conditions of the Act. He was
    prepared to prove that it was due to a temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation
    appliances, and was removed when the ventilation was put right. After evidence
    had been given on both sides, it was agreed between Mr. Morley and Mr. Cooper
    that the question at issue was really a legal one as to the meaning of the Act
    with regard to the conditions under which shot-firing should not take place. The
    Court was therefore asked not to give its decision, but to adjourn the case until
    the legal question had been referred to a superior court. The case was adjourned

    M.P., presented on behalf the Crown, and Mr. R. F. Cooper, Newcastle,

    appeared for the owners. Mr. Morley said the prosecution was taken under

    35 and 36 Vic., chap. 76, of the Mines Regulation Act. With regard to

    the use of gunpowder, it was provided that it should only be used in

    cartridges, and not within three months after any inflammable gas had

    been found in the mine. The prosecution relied in this case of the fact

    that inflammable gas had been found in the mine within three months of

    the firing of the shot, and the question was whether the regulation had

    been complied with, it being requisite under the Act for some competent

    person duly appointed for that purpose to examine the place where the

    shot was to be fired immediately before the firing, and not to allow it

    to be discharged except it was safe to do so. It was also provided that

    persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be out of it or that

    part of it where the explosive was to be used. Mr. Cooper said he did

    not dispute that gas had been found, but it was not found within the

    conditions of the Act. He was prepared to prove that it was due to a

    temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation appliances, and was

    removed when the ventilation was put right. After evidence had been

    given on both sides, it was agreed between Mr. Morley and Mr. Cooper

    that the question at issue was really a legal one as to the meaning of

    the Act with regard to the conditions under which shot-firing should not

    take place. The Court was, therefore, asked not to give its decision,

    but to adjourn the case until the legal question had been referred to a

    superior court. The case was adjourned accordingly.'

    of the man Dasant, deposed that on March 25th, the day of the robbery, the prisoner
    Palmer called on her and beckoned her to the corner of the street. He asked for

    pack up her luggage and leave the house at once, and leave her luggage in the
    cloakroom. He said, "You know where Weiner lives; you must go down to him and

    Station, and afterwards went to Adolphe Weiner''s house, where she packed the
    luggage and left for Waiterloo Station the same day. She then went to Jacoby''s
    house, but he was not at home. She saw him, however, on the following Friday at
    his place in the Edgware road. He said he did not know they were going to strike
    him. Witness told him that her father had told her about the affair from the beginning.
    He denied at first that he knew anything about it. She told him that her father
    had given her £10 to assist her, and that she must give him £5 every week until
    she got employment. He said he would not assist her at all, and then gave her
    £5. He promised to do so again, and met her between the two bridges in Avon-street
    on Monday. She gave him £10 for her father''s maintenance in the House of Detention.

    AT the Bow-street Police-court, five men named James Palmer, Samuel

    Scandland, Leon Weiner, Adolphe Weiner, and Daniel Jacoby, have been

    charged with being concerned with a man (already convicted) named

    Dusant, with attempting to murder Jules Tabak, a diamond merchant, and

    stealing £2,000 worth of diamonds. Inspector Languish deposed that from

    information received he went with other officers and arrested the

    accused on the present charge. Mr. Tabak, a diamond merchant of 5

    Belgrave-street, Euston-road, deposed that on March 25th, two men came

    to his house, and asked him to show them some diamonds. Two parcels were

    shown them. While the men were looking at the diamonds the prisoner

    Palmer struck witness to heavy blows on the head. He was stunned, the

    two men ran away, and stole one hundred and eighty carats of diamonds,

    value £1,400. One of the men (Dusant) was arrested, and has since been

    convicted and sentenced to penal servitude. He positively identified

    Palmer as the other man. Mrs. Tabak was called, and identified Palmer as

    one of the men concerned in the robbery. She did not identify him at

    first. Eleanor Denunzio, the daughter of the man Dusant, deposed that on

    March 25th, the day of the robbery, the prisoner Palmer called on her

    and beckoned her to the corner of the street. He asked for her father.

    He said, “I struck the old man. He screamed, and his wife came upstairs

    and we were obliged to run away. I daresay your father will blame me for

    all this, but my brother was outside and did all he could to stop the

    servant.” Witness asked if the servant was stopped. Prisoner replied in

    the negative. She asked if her father had got away. Prisoner replied,

    “No,” and told her she had better pack up her luggage and get away from

    the house at once, and leave her luggage in the cloakroom. He said, “You

    know where Weiner lives. You must go down to him and tell him to assist

    you Witness packed up her luggage and took it to Waterloo Station, and

    afterwards went to Adolphs Weiner’s house. She packed the luggage and

    sent it to Waterloo Station the same day. She then went to 6, Dyer’s

    Buildings and saw Adolphe Weinger. Directly he saw her he said “For

    God’s sake go away! I will meet you in Castle-street.” She went there,

    where he shortly joined her, and took her to a wine shop in Chancery

    lane. Witness said, “You have got my father into this trouble, and I

    shall expect you to get him out of it.” He denied at first that he knew

    anything about it. She told him that her father had told her about the

    affair from the beginning. He said that all he did was to get her father

    a situation. She said she know that was false, and that he spent her

    father to Mr. Tabak, first he had said he would not assist her at all,

    and then he gave her 5s., and said he would give her that every week

    until she got employment. He said whatever she did she must not come

    near Dyer’s Buildings, because he was watched. The she went to Jacoby’s

    house, but he was not at home. She saw him, however, on the following

    Friday at his place in the Edgware-road. He said he did not know they

    were going to strike him. Witness told him he must take the money for

    her father’s maintenance in the House of Detention. He promised to do

    so, and met witness the next night in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. She

    gave him 10s, for her father. On the following Monday she was to meet

    the elder Weiner, who promised to give her £2 12s. for the rent then due

    by her father. Weiner did not turn up, but subsequently she saw Jacoby,

    who gave her £3 to pay the rent. He told her no’s to go to Weiner’s

    place at all. He promised to meet her at the Marble Arch the following

    Wednesday, but by the advice of Palmer and his wife she did not go. On

    March 25th, after seeing Palmer, she went to the house of his

    mother-in-law. He came in and sent for his wife. They took witness to

    their house, and sent for her luggage from Waterloo. She remained in the

    house for nine weeks. Witness knew the whole of the prisoners, who were

    in the habit of coming to the house of witness’s father. Three weeks

    after Christmas Jacoby called at their house with a bottle of

    chloroform. They tried it on the kitten. On a subsequent occasion the

    elder Weiner took a rabbit to the house and witness was ordered out of

    the room. When she returned the windows were open, and there was a

    strong smell of chloroform im the room. She believed they had tried it

    on the rabbit. The accused, who protested their innocence, were

    remanded.'

    "THE HIRE SYSTEM. At the Sliereditch County Court, the case of Dver and Son, Ltd.,
    vs. Neal and Mr. S. Carler has been tried by Judge Prentice. The plaintiffs are
    piano-forte manufacturers, of 14 Stoke Newington-road, and they alleged that Mrs.
    Neal, who is a laundress, and Mr. Casrter, an oilman, had detained the piano belonging
    to them without permission, and they claimed the value of the piano, �23 2s.,
    as well as damages for the use of the instrument during the period it was withheld.
    Mr. Pilmore appeared for the plaintiffs, while Mr. Davis represented the defendants.
    The plaintiffs'' claim was that in December, SSI, Mrs. Neal had taken possession
    of the piano belonging to them without their consent. The hire value of the instrument
    was �283 2s., and �2 2.10 was paid at once, with the balance of �10 5.10 being
    paid at the rate of �10 5.10 per month until the instrument became their property
    if they so desired. After paying the rent for three months in arrears, but before
    the next payment was due, Mrs. Neal discovered that Mr. Carler was her landlord,
    and she paid him the rent owing to him. The total amount of rent due was �45 10s.,
    with �2 10s. being for costs and �23 10s. being for arrears. Mrs. Neal undertook
    to pay the rent, but Mr. Carler refused to accept it, claiming that he had already

    plaintiffs and awarded them �2 10s. in costs."

    AT the Shoreditch County Court the case of Dyer and Son v. Mrs. Neal and

    Mr. S. Carter has been tried by Judge Prentice. The plaintiffs are

    pianoforte manufacturers, of 14 Stoke Newington-road, and they claimed

    of Mrs. Neal, who is a laundress, and Mr. Carter, an oilman, the sum of

    £23 2s., the value of a piano detained, and £22s, damages for the

    defendants having converted the instrument to their own use. Mr. Palmor

    appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Davis was counsel for the

    defendants. The plaintiffs'' case was that in December, 1884, Mrs. Neal

    had a piano of them upon the hire system. The cost of the instrument was

    £23 2s., and £22s, was paid at once, and the remainder was to be paid at

    the rate of £1 1s. a month, the piano to become her property if she paid

    all the instalments. After paying three instalments she got into

    arrears, but in August last, when £6 6s was due, she paid £8 10s.,

    making £13 15s, paid altogether. Soon after that she moved away, and it

    was about two months before she was found. It was then discovered that

    the defendant Carter, who was her landlord, had taken the piano in pawn

    for rent. The sum of £4 10s, was due for rent, and Mrs. Neal under took

    to per £46 in six months or forfeit the piano, Cross-examined: The

    agreement was read over to Mrs. Neal -fore she signed it. His Honour:

    Why did she pay £8 10s, when only £6 6s, was due? The # said it was of

    her own free will, His Honour: People do not usually pay more than is

    due. In answer to further questions, it was admitted for plaintiffs that

    they were told they could hare the piano if they paid £6, the amount of

    the indebtedness of Mrs. Neal to Mr. Carter, but they refused to do

    that. They were also offered the balance due on the agreement for the

    piano, but they refused to accept it. His Honour, in the result, said he

    must hold that the agreement was good, but be would assist the

    defendants as much as he could. The plaintiffs acted very improperly in

    not accepting the balance due under the agreement when it was rendered.

    He was very sorry that he must give a verdict in their favour, but he

    should only allow 1s damages, £9 7s. the balance of the £23 2s. and £2

    9s, 10d. the costs of the court. Had the £9 7s. held paid into court he

    would have given judgment for the defendants.'

    "I ATTEMPTED MURDER AT STAMFORD HILL. On Saturday night an extraordinary and apparently
    deliberate attempt to murder a woman, the wife of a house and estate agent named
    Tomlinson, of 7, Champion-terrace, Stamford Hill, took place in the public thoroughfare,
    about one hundred yards distance from her residence. She left home at twenty minutes
    past nine for the purpose of making a few purchases, and was almost immediately
    accosted by a man from behind. She turned round at once, and found that it was
    her sister''s husband, William Esworthy. He walked by her side for a second or
    two, and then suddenly fired a pistol at the back of her head. She screamed. Murder;
    I am shot, and fell to the ground insensible. A girl living on the spot ran across
    the road and recognized Mrs. Tomlinson as she lay bleeding on the pavement. Being
    Saturday night there were many people about. A crowd soon assembled, and the injured
    woman having been carried into her own house, Dr. Duncan, of Amherst Park, was
    sent for. He soon arrived, and found her suffering from a bullet wound behind
    the right ear, but the bullet had not penetrated the skull, having bounded off
    after striking the bone. Search was subsequently made for the bullet, but it could
    not be found. After the woman fell, Esworthy hurried to the opposite side of the
    street, and threw something over a fence. He had been seen to fire the pistol
    by some passersby, and was seized by several men, who took him towards the Stoke
    Newington Police-station. They were met, however, by Sergeant Collins, of the
    N Division, to whom they reported the circumstances of the case, and gave the
    man into his custody. Collins, accompanied by a great many persons, conveyed Esworthy
    to the Tottenham Police-station. There he was charged with shooting and wounding
    with intent to murder one Harriet Tomlinson, at the High-road, Stamford Hill.
    In the parish of Tottenham. He gave the name of William Esworthy, aged twenty-eight,
    address 29, South-street, Manchester-square; business, commission agent. On the
    charge being read over to him heremarked, She did it herself, and I took the revolver
    away from her, and threw it over a fence on the opposite side of the road. On
    being searched a few coins and a cleaning-rod of a pistol was found upon him,
    but no ammunition. The prisoner having been locked up, Inspector Ashwell and Sergeant
    Collins proceeded to the spot indicated by him to search for the revolver; but,
    after a close inspection for an hour or so, they had not succeeded in finding
    it. The search then discontinued; it was resumed on Sunday morning at daylight
    by Sergeant Collins, and at a quarter-past five o''clock he discovered the revolver
    in a builder''s yard, almost opposite where the crime was committed. It is a weapon
    with seven chambers, six of which were loaded when it was picked up. It was therefore
    fully charged when the attack was made upon Mrs. Tomlinson. In investigating the
    matter on Sunday the police ascertained that the prisoner spent nearly the whole
    of Saturday afternoon and evening watching the playing of cricket on some vacant
    land at the rear of Champion-terrace. After the match was over he was seen to
    pass Tomlinsons place of business and go to a public-house, where he had some
    whisky. He then repassed the shop, and evidently waited about in the expectation
    that Mrs. Tomlinson would come out, as she eventually did, to make Saturday night''s
    purchases. As to the motive for the outrage, it is stated that there had been

  handwritten_text_raw: I ATTEMPTED MURDER AT STAMFORD HILL. ON Saturday night an
    extraordinary and apparently deliberate attempt to murder a woman, the wife of
    a house and estate agent named Tomlinson, of 7, Champion-terrace, Stamford Hill,
    took place in the public thoroughfare, about one hundred yards dis- tance from
    her residence. She left home at twenty minutes past nine for the purpose of making
    a few purchases, and was almost immediated accosted by a man from behind. She
    turned round at once, and found that it was her sister's husband, William Eiworthy.
    He walked by her side for a second or two, and then suddenly fired a pistol at
    the back of her head. She secreamed. "Murder; I am shot i and fell to the ground
    insensible. A'girl living on the spot ran across the road and recognised Mrs.
    Tomlinson as she lay bleeding on the pavement. Being Saturday night there were
    many people about. A crowdsoon assembled, and the. injured woman having been car-
    ried into her own house, Dr. Duncan, of Amherst Park, was sent for. He soon arrived,
    and found her suffering from a bullet wound behind the right ear, but the bullet
    had not penetrated the skull, having bounded off after striking the bone. Search
    was subsequently made for the bullet, but it could not be found. After the woman
    fell Esworthy hurried to the opposite side of the street, and threw something
    over a fence. He had been seen to fire the pistol by some passers by, and was
    seized by several men, who took him towards the Stoke Newington Police-station.
    They were met, however, by Sergeant Collins, of the N Division, to whom they reported
    the circumstances of the case, and gave the man into his custody. Collins, accompanied
    by a great many persons, conveyed Esworthy to the Tottenham Police-station. There
    he was charged with "shooting and wounding with intent to murder one Harriet Tomlinson,
    at the High-road, Stamford Hill. In the parieh of Tottenham." He gave the name
    of William Esworthy, ngedtwenty-eight, address 29, South-street, Manchester-square;
    business, commis- sion agent. On the charge being read over to him he remarked,
    "She did it herself, and I took the revolver away from her, and threw it over
    a fence on the opposite side of the road." On being searched a few coins and a
    cleaning-rod of a pistol was found upon him, but no ammunition. The prisoner having
    been locked up, Inspector Ashwell and Sergeant Collins proceeded to the spot Indicated
    by him to search for the revolver; but, after a close inspec- tion for an hour
    or so, they had not succeeded in finding it, The search then discontinued; it
    was re- sumed on Sunday morning at daylight by Sergeant Collins, and at a quarter-past
    five o'clock he dis- covered the revolver in a builder's yard, almost opposite
    where the crime was committed. It is a weapon with seven chambers, six of which
    were loaded when It was picked up. It was, therefore, fully charged when the attack
    was made upon Mrs. Tomlinson. In investigating the matter on Sunday the police
    ascertained that the prisoner spent nearly the whole of Saturday afternoon and
    evening watching the playing of cricket on some vacant land at the rear of Champion-terrace.
    After the match was over he was seen to pass Tomlinson's place of business and
    go to a public-house, where he had some whisky. He then repassed the shop, and
    evidently waited about in the expectation that Mrs. Tomlinson would come out,
    as she eventually did, to make Saturday night's purchases. As to the motive for
    the outrage, it Is stated that there had been serious disagreements between the
    prisoner and his wife, and that Mrs. Tomlinson had supported her sister's cause,
    and invited herto come to Stamford Hill and stay there on several occasions, which
    she had done. Mrs. Tom- linson, is the mother of two children, and is much respected
    by her neighbours, who express great sym- pathy towards her in her suffering,
    and make anxious inquiries as to her condition, It is clear that she had a miraculous
    escape from death. As it is she is badly wounded, and her system has received
    a very severe shock, but there is scarcely any fear of her ultimate recovery.
    On Sunday evening the symp- toms were highly favourable to that view. As may be
    imagined, the affair, happening in a crowded thoroughfare at a busy time on Saturday
    night, created intense excitement. Prisoner will be taken before the magistrates
    at Edmonton in a day or two.

    of an assault which it was possible to bring were present. After arguments, Lord

    Hackney-wick, were charged on remand with being in a disused oilcloth factory
    in rt Glyn-road, Clapton-park, supposed for the purpose of committing a felony.
    The boys were found in the building at ten o''clock on the previous Saturday morning.
    They had evidently made the place their home. The elder boy was armed with a catapult,
    and in his possession were a number of lead pellets. The extensive building had
    been almost stripped of its piping, and there were evidences that the lead supplied
    had been melted down to make pellets for the catapults, which were used to shoot
    the numerous birds nested in the roof of the building, which were afterwards cooked
    and eaten. On the house where Arnold resided, being searched, a chisel fashioned
    like a burglar''s jemmy was found, together with a silver-plated teapot and cream
    jug, and several plated spoons. It was ascertained that these had been stolen
    from a house in Percy-terrace, Mande-ville-street, Clapton. The owner was not
    present, and Constable 208 J said there was no further evidence to connect the
    prisoners with the robbery at that house. A solicitor representing the owner,
    who is away in Russia, said that during the past few years £700 worth of damage
    had been done to the buildings by boys. A wall eight feet high surrounded the
    building, and as the inner staircase had long since disappeared he was at a loss
    to know how the boys got to the top floor. Arnold said they got over the outer
    wall from some gardens at the back, so and having forced the windows, they climbed
    up the beams to the top floor. The solicitor added that great danger might arise
    to adjoining property by such boys indulging in fires on the floor. The boys seemed
    to have been neglected by their parents, one mother admitting that she had taken
    a situation as a housekeeper and left the boy to shift for himself. Mr. O. Corser
    said Bushell appeared to be the ringleader, and he probably had led the other
    boys away. He would have ten days imprisonment and be detained for five years
    in a reformatory. The younger boys would go to the workhouse for a week, and Mr.
    Hiscocks, the School Board officer, would find industrial schools for them."'

    Overberry-road, Hackney-wick, were charged on remand with being in a

    lead so obtained had been melted down to make pellets for the catapults,

    which were used to shoot the numerous birds nested in the roof of the

    building, which were afterwards cooked and eaten. On the house where

    Arnold resided being searched a chisel fashioned like a burglar''s

    "jemmy" was found, together with a silver-plated teapot and cream jug,

    and several plated spoons, which it was ascertained had been stolen from

    a house in Percy-terrace, Mandeville-street, Clapton. The owner was not

    present, and Constable 208 J said there was no further evidence to

    the public footway at First-street, Chelsea, by preaching therein, and with refusing
    to give his name and address when requested to do so by Police-sergeant Howlett,
    3 B Reserve. There was another charge against Arthur Reynolds, twenty-two, captain

    disorderly conduct, causing a crowd to assemble, and refusing to disperse, at
    Walton-street, Chelsea, whereby the thoroughfare was obstructed, and a breach
    of the peace rendered probable. The court was crowded with persons interested
    in the case. Mr. Superintendent Shepherd watched the proceedings on behalf of
    the police authorities, Inspector Doogan conducting the case. The prisoners were
    ranged in two lines across the court. Half a dozen of them were in the uniform
    of the Salvation Army. The others presented the appearance of respectable working
    men. Mr. Safford, chief clerk, said he had a letter from Colonel Nicol, at the
    headquarters of the Army, asking that the prisoners might be remanded till counsel
    could be instructed for the defense. Captain Reynolds: I have to ask for a remand,
    sir. We have had no time to get legal advice. Mr. Sheil: Why have they not sent
    some one from your headquarters? Captain Reynolds: They have not had time, sir.
    We all had to be here at ten oclock this morning. Mr. Safford: The prisoners were
    admitted to bail between four and five oclock on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sheil:
    What time do you ask for? Mr. Parsons, an officer from the Salvation Army headquarters,
    appeared on behalf of Messrs. Burton, Matthews, and Ranger, solicitors for the
    Salvation Army, to ask for a remand for three or four days for the purpose of
    instructing counsel. Mr. Sheil: I shall do nothing of the sort; it is a ridiculous
    request. I will remand them until tomorrow, if you like. Mr. Parsons still pressed
    for a remand. Mr. Sheil: Very well; I will remand them on the same bail as before.
    A police witness: But, your worship, I have already been kept here since eleven
    oclock this morning. Mr. Sheil: I cant help it. If I do not give them time to
    get counsel it will be a great grievance. I will remand the prisoners to any day
    that will suit the witnesses. Mr. Superintendent Shepherd: The whole of the prisoners
    have been on bail since Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sheil: I will go on with the case.
    After a moment''s consideration, Mr. Sheil added: No, I think, on consideration
    of the circumstances, that I will adjourn the case till a later date. The prisoners
    must be ready with their defense then. A witness: Your honour, there are over

    Point d''Hill House, July 9th, 1889. Dear Sir, - You need not trouble about my
    case. I am innocent of the charge I am accused of. The police can prosecute a
    dead body; they cannot follow the soul. I am not afraid to meet my God. Man is
    the greatest enemy man has got. If the police would try to prevent crime instead
    of laying traps to create it, there would not be one half the misery in the world
    there is. "S.D." is the god of all classes, including persons not excepted. I
    am hunted down for trying to do good. My only object, motive, or intention on
    the 25th of June was to do good to the dear little children. For me to come into
    court with only one witness when they have four coached and trained for so one
    week before they took action, and another week to complete it; had I the opportunity
    to go into the witness-box, my mouth is closed, I should not have taken the step
    I have. Hoping you will read this to the Court, and try to open the way to remove
    the great obstruction to justice by keeping a culprit''s folio mouth closed in
    defense of his innocence, believe me, yours respectfully, - J.J. NORMAN.

    some shots from a gun, some of the missiles entering his left eye. The

    gun was fired by a lad of fourteen, named Charles Hills, of

    Scudder''s-lane, Bexley, to whom it had been lent. He pointed it, he

    says, at two sparrows, and did not see Browning until he cried out, when

    he became frightened and ran away. The injured man has lost the sight of

    his left eye, and several shots have been extracted from his face and

    ears.


    THOMAS BURKE, nineteen, a slater, of Anatola-road, Upper Holloway, was

    charged before Mr. Bros, at the Dalston Police-court, on Monday

    afternoon, with disturbing the members of the Salvation Army by shouting

    and swearing and using disgusting language inside the "army " barracks,

    a duly registered place of worship, at Salisbury-road, Upper Holloway.

    “Lieutenant” Bessie Bellamy deposed that the previous afternoon the

    prisoner was at the service as stated, and talked loudly and persisted

    in singing when others had stopped. He talked loudly whilst the captain

    was reading the Bible. Sergeant Smith deposed to hearing the

    disturbance, and to asking the prisoner to withdraw. He refused, but on

    subsequently being detained until a policeman was fetched he asked in a

    loud voice, "What the devil are you keeping me here for?" The bad

    language alleged to have been used by prisoner was spoken to; and

    Police-constable 50 YR having said the prisoner was violent and threw

    him when arrested, Mr. Bros passed sentence of one month''s hard labour.

    A woman at the back of the court screamed and fainted on hearing this.'

    AT the Southwark County Court, on Monday morning, before his Honour

    Judge Holroyd, the case of Didcott v. Macdermots was heard. Mr.

    Armstrong, solicitor, appeared for the plaintiff, who, he said, was a

    musical and dramatic agent. Defendant was a comedian and vocalist, and

    was also an agent, and the action was brought against him to recover the

    sum of £35 11s. 8d., being commission due upon engagements procured for

    him by the plaintiff. The first item was commission at five percent upon

    Mr. Macdermott''s engagement at the London Pavilion at £20 per week, on

    which engagement there were twenty-three weeks'' commission due up to

    July 29th. Then there was commission at five per cent upon Mr.

    Macdermott''s engagements at the Cambridge Music Hall £15 per week, and

    at Collins''s at £12 12s. per week; upon two engagements at Edinburgh and

    Newcastle at £30 per week and at the Star, in Dublin, at £40 per week.

    Mr. R. Andrews, the plaintiff''s clerk, was called to prove the claim,

    and produced the contracts in respect of which the action was brought.

    The defendant said he was quite prepared to pay the plaintiff £24 1s.

    8d., and had brought a cheque with him for that sum. He said he objected

    to pay commission upon all re engagements. Not only as that unusual,

    but-- His Honour: I never saw an engagement upon which there was not

    commission payable upon re-engagements. Mr. Armstrong: Mr. Didcott made

    this man. He was nobody before Mr. Didcott took him up. The Defendant

    (excitedly): I was Macdermott before Mr. Didcott ever came into the

    business. Mr. Armstrong: You are an agent yourself? Defendant: No, I am

    not an agent. Mr. Armstrong: What does "Macdermott''s Universal Dramatic

    and Musical Agency" mean, then? Defendant: That is my brother, Edward

    Macdermott. Mr. Armstrong: Don''t you know that the usual commission is

    ten percent.? Defendant: Not with a man of my reputation. Big turns like

    myself pay five per cent. His honour remarked that where a man put his

    hand to a certain document, and that document was brought into court, he

    could not go away from it. He gave judgment for the plaintiff for the

    amount claimed. The defendant offered to hand over his cheque for £24

    1s. 8d. Mr. Armstrong: We would rather not take his cheque, sir.

    Defendant (excitedly): He has borrowed money of me and my family. I have

    been brought here to be insulted. Mr. Didcott: He has said he is not an

    agent. I shall be able to prove right up to the hilt that he is an

    agent. The parties then left the court.'

    behind, and saw her moving her hands in a very suspicious manner amongst the ladies
    dresses. Witness followed her to the church porch, and then thought it best to
    take her. He noticed that she bad her gloves on during the service, but now she
    had the glove off her right hand. Witness took the child back to a pew, and noticing
    her moving her hands he asked one of his colleagues to see if anything had dropped
    upon the floor. They found a crimson plush purse containing a flarin and a penny,
    at her feet, and she eaid this belonged to her and con. fained a penny. Witness
    subsequently asked her when she began to do this, and she said that a servant
    that she had met on the beach at Herne Bay had taught her how to do it. Cross-examined:
    He would most certainly have charged the child from what he saw, even if he had
    not found the purse. H~e had never seen the child do anything of the kind before.
    He did not give the child into custody on suspicion, because lie knew that she
    did it. Mr. George Collier, commercial traveller, alEo a deacon at Rectory-road,
    said : When the child was taken into the vestry I took hold of the dear little
    thing by the hand and asked her to sib down on the sofa, She said she lived at

    Now, my dear little child, tell me why you have done this. She replied, I have
    not done it. I said, Now, tell nae, and we will befriend you. Mr. Bros: I am not
    sure I can take any more of your evidence. There is an inducement for her to make
    a confession, which is not evidence. Mr. Henry Fitzhenry, another commercial traveller,
    and deacon of the church in question, said that he e recognised the child as one

    amongst ladies dresses. He generally corroborated I the other witnesses. By Mr.

    address, and E from inquiries he made lie was of opinion that the childs parents
    were respectable. Mtr. Bros On this s evidence I shall remand the girl In custody

    belongs to the child I might entertain your application. Mr. Romain: I can prove
    she is a quiet, well-behaved child, who has a money-box and saves most that she

    examined was John TI-rim Tarner, the uncle of the deceased, who deposed that the
    boy and his father, James, a labourer, had resided with him for some time; but
    in consequence of some remarks he had made to his brother, the latter took the
    boy away to his grandmother''s house, and asked for a night''s lodging there.
    - As it was not convenient for them to stay, they went back to the house they
    formerly occupied, and slept in a shed at the back of the building, the father
    taking some of his clothing to cover his son. The following day, the father visited
    a bershouse several times, and his brother John, finding him there, asked him
    to go home and have a cup of tea, which he refused. Nothing more was seen of them
    until about half-past one on Thursday morning, when the father returned to his
    brother''s house alone, and upon being questioned by the wife as to where the
    boy was, replied that he did not know, but afterwards stated that he had walked
    straight into the well pond. It was noticed that his clothes were wet and his
    face muddy, and the wife told him to change his clothes and get into bed, which
    he did. Upon his brother coming down in the morning, he went to Claxby to another
    brother, but found that the boy was not there. Together the two brothers returned
    to Alford, stopping on their way to examine the fish pond at the well, but found
    nothing. Upon receiving a letter, which led to the brother going to Claxby, and
    which was from the cousin of the child, it was found that a certain passage which
    had been overlooked stated that the bodies of the father and son would be found
    in the brick-pit. They went to the place and found the body of the boy. Medical
    evidence having been given that death was caused by drowning, and formal evidence
    as to the very peculiar behaviour of the father on Wednesday evening and to his
    subsequent arrest, the coroner summed up, and a verdict of wilful murder against
    Joseph Turner was returned. The father is stated to have been deeply attached
    to his son."

    ALLEGED INGENIOUS FRAUDS.


    AT the Bilston Police-court, on Friday, John Herbert Brown, thirty-two,

    a bookbinder by trade, but who had conferred upon himself the title of

    Dr. G. H. Adamson, of Park House, Leeds, was committed for trial on six

    different charges of fraud. The circumstances, although almost the same

    in each case, were of a most extraordinary character. The prisoner, it

    appears, adopted the plan of first making himself acquainted with

    persona resident in Bilston, West Bromwich, and other parts of the

    district who had relatives in Australia; he then waited upon them, and,

    stating that he had just come over from the colony on a short visit,

    said he was entrusted with friendly inquiries from their absent

    relatives. By this means it is alleged he managed to obtain quantities

    of valuable articles in the form of jewellery and trinkets, which he

    promised to convey on his return to Australia to the individuals for

    whom they were intended. At West Bromwich, it seems, he slightly altered

    his tactics. Having obtained from a Mrs. Willis, wife of a grocer, a

    number of small articles as presents to her married daughter, he went

    straightway to another West Bromwich grocer named Hodgetts, and handed

    over the articles he had obtained from Mrs. Willis as presents from

    their absent brother, who was about to be married. The hair quickly

    took, and prisoner was made the happy recipient of a gold albert guard

    and silver Jubilees brooch and other valuables as presents for the

    intending bride and bridegroom, and intrinsically worth about three

    times the articles he had given in exchange Prisoner offered no defence,

    and he was committed for trial.'

    On Saturday, at the Bow-street Police-court, Thomas Jones, Duke-street,

    Bloomsbury, a clerk, was summoned for an alleged assault on a woman

    named Annie Ellis. The complainant made a sensational statement to Mr.

    Bridge on the previous Saturday, in which she alleged that at an early

    hour that morning she had been induced to accompany a man into a side

    street in Oxford street, where, she averred, he knocked her down and

    threatened her if she called out. At the same time she alleged that he

    had an open clasp-knife in his hand, and covered her face with a white

    witnesses, who caught the man, but he escaped, and ran into a house. She

    proceeded to the Tottenham-court-road Police-station with the two

    witnesses and gave information. Mr. Bridge directed inquiries to be

    made, with the result that the present summons was issued. Mr. P. T

    Blackwell appeared for the defence. Referring to the detailed statement

    made by the woman on the last occasion, he said that he understood the

    woman had not been seen since. She obtained some money from the

    magistrate. Mr. Vaughan asked if the police had made inquiries.

    Inspector Mulford said that he had telegraphed to the address the woman

    gave, at Woolwich, and a reply was received that she was not known, and

    had not been seen there. Mr. Bridge had given her 1s. 6d. to pay her

    fare to Woolwich, and advised her to go to the work house. Witness

    afterwards saw her coming out of a public-house in Deury-lane. Nothing

    was known of her in the neighbourhood. Mr. Blackwell said the fullest

    possible publicity was given to her statement, and he was prepared to

    give the clearest possible account of the defendant''s movements on the

    evening in question. Inspector Mulford said the two men who had given

    their names did not appear now as witnesses. One had given a false

    address, and the other was described by his landlady as a person whore

    word could not be relied upon. Mr. Blackwell was instructed that one of

    the witnesses called at Mr. Jones''s house that morning, but he refused

    to see him. Mr. Jones was a respectable young man, living with his

    mother at the address given. He attributed the annoyance and trouble

    caused him to the fact of having a fortnight ago charged a woman with

    stealing a sovereign purse, which he wore in his waistcoat pocket. He

    afterwards found it in his overcoat pocket, minus the chain, and at once

    informed the police of the fact, and the woman was discharged. He

    thought this charge of alleged assault had been "got up" in consequence.

    The complainant and her witnesses were called, but did not answer. Mr.

    Vaughan said the charge might have originated from an egregious mistake,

    or might have been a trumped-up one, but the statement made by the woman

    bore on it the impress of truth and necessitated inquiries. Inasmuch as

    neither the complainant nor her witnesses were present it seemed that

    the only conclusion that could be arrived at was that it was a

    "STRANGE CONFESSION OF MURDER. A clan named Walter Hassell, who described himself
    as a clerk, has been charged at the Bow Street Police-court, before Mr. Vaughan,
    on his own confession, with the murder of a private in the Kings Royal Rifle Corps,
    named Downey. Detective Inspector Conquest said that, in company with Sergeant
    Nash, he saw the prisoner that morning on his release from Millbank Prison, and
    said to him, ''We are police officers, and are going to arrest you, in consequence
    of a statement you have made.'' After receiving the usual caution, he adhered
    to what he had stated. In his confession, he described himself as a late private
    of the 4th Battalion Kings Royal Rifle Corps, and now of the first-class Army
    Reserve. He stated that early in March, 1888, when stationed at Camp Umballa,
    India, he murdered Private Downey by cutting his throat with a razor. It was about
    a quarter to ten p.m., after tattoo. Having obtained permission to go to the latrine,
    the prisoner went and hid himself behind some trees on the main road leading to

    "THE TAUNTON RAILWAY DISASTER. On Saturday, the Taunton Assizes opened, with Mr.
    Justice le Grantham presiding. His lordship, in addressing the grand jury, referred
    to the charge against George Rice, a signalman, of causing the death of ten persons
    at Norton or Fitewarren, and said that it was undoubtedly true that the defendant
    had a duty to perform and did not do so, and therefore in consequence of his not
    doing so, the lives of ten persons at least were sacrificed. The law on the point
    was that everyone who contracted to perform certain duties upon which the preservation
    of life depended, and who neglected to perform those duties, and thereby caused
    the death of any person, committed the same offence as if he had caused the same
    effect by an act done. It would be for the jury to consider what was the state
    of the man''s mind when he was guilty of the offence-in other words, whether the
    neglect was culpable. He considered that they should find a true bill. - The grand
    jury retired, and after deliberating, returned into court with a true bill against
    the prisoner. They made a presentment to the effect that the attention of the
    Government should be called to the great danger involved in allowing trains to
    be shunted upon the main lines-George Rice, sixty-three, signalman, was then indicted
    for the manslaughter of Robert Walker and nine other persons at Norton Fitzwarren
    on November 11th. Mr. Douglas Metcalfe and Mr. Warry prosecuted; and Mr. Charles
    Mathews defended, whilst a number of counsel watched the proceedings on behalf
    of the Great Western Company. - The prisoner pleaded not guilty. Noblo, the driver
    of the goods train, was examined, and said he was on the up line nine or ten minutes
    before the special came up. He did not think the driver of the special could have
    seen his light at a greater distance than one hundred and fifty yards, and if
    the red light had been showing, the speed of the special could not have been materially
    reduced, as it is a light train, and the rails were greasy. - Evidence was given
    that the prisoner suffered from a fracture of the ribs and slight lacerations
    about the head. His hours were from a quarter-past nine in the morning to a quarter
    past seven in the evening, alternately. Tovey, the telegraph clerk at Exeter,
    is proved apprising Rice of the dispatch of the special train. - Albert Allen,
    signalman at the Victor crossing, next to Norton, on the Exeter side, proved receiving
    the same notification, and receiving it at eighteen minutes past one. Line clear.
    - Mr. Kemp, the Norton stationmaster, gave particulars as to when Rice went on
    duty. Mr. Wallington, a survivor of the first carriage, also gave evidence. -
    Dr. Willcocks stated that three weeks before the collision Rice was at his surgery,
    and he prescribed for pains in his head. - Mr. Campfield, district superintendent,
    said it was optional with the signalman to shunt the goods train on one of the
    branch lines. This concluded the case for the prosecution. - Mr. Charles Mathews

    do not enjoy very good health. On Thursday night when I came home my nose bled
    violently.'' On the 31st of October he handed over to Dr. Pepper certain ci articles
    found in the prisoner''s room. Ellen Barrand, of 141, Prince of Wales-road, said
    she was the landlady of the house. She knew the prisoner, and she had gone backwards
    and forwards to her house where Mr. and Mrs. Hogg had lived. A fortnight before
    the murder she saw the prisoner ring the first-floor bell. Mrs. Hogg''s mother
    was out, and when the deceased woman came down and opened the door, Mrs. Hogg
    and the prisoner stood talking for a few moments, after which they both went upstairs.
    The prisoner remained there a short time. Either on the Thursday or Friday before
    the murder she heard the doorbell ring, and a boy went away from the door after

    knock at the door of the first house. The door was opened by a woman, but he could
    not say whether it was the prisoner. Mr. Hogg was recalled and asked a number
    of questions as to where he was working on the day of the murder, and his statements
    substantially bore out the evidence previously given by him. Mr. Bond, of Westminster
    Hospital, repeated the medical testimony given by him at the inquest. He said
    there was no blood in the passage or front room. The floor of the kitchen had
    the appearance of having been cleaned. He examined the prisoner''s hands at Kentish-town
    Police-station after her arrest and found several superficial scratches and abrasions
    which had been recently inflicted. Some of the hairs found in the prisoner''s
    kitchen corresponded with those of the deceased woman. The severing of the head
    would enable it to be doubled to either under or above the body, and thus the
    body could be more easily placed in the bassinette. He could not say whether or

    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION]


    AT the Marylebone Police-court, on Tuesday, Eleanor Wheeler, otherwise

    Pearcey, was brought up before Mr. Cooke on remand charged with the

    murder of Mrs. Phoebe Hogg and her infant daughter on the 24th of last

    month at Hampstead. There was again a large crowd outside the building,

    and great anxiety was shown to gain admission to the court. The prisoner

    was brought down the prison van from Holloway. Detective Edward Parsons

    gave evidence as to the examination of the bloodstains in the kitchen.

    The other officers who were with him left, and he was for a time in the

    front room with the prisoner at 2, Priory-road. She said, "I have not

    told a lie. I have not been asked a question. Mrs. Hogg did come here at

    six o''clock, and asked me to lend her two shillings and to mind the

    child. I told her I could not lend her the money as I had none, and I

    could not mind the child as I was going out. I told Clara Hogg about it,

    and she advised me to say nothing about it, as it would be such a

    disgrace if people thought her husband kept her short of money."

    Afterwards the prisoner said, "I do not enjoy very good health. On

    Thursday night when I came home my nose bled violently." On the 31st of

    October he handed over to Dr. Pepper certain articles found in the

    prisoner''s room. Ellen Barrand, of 141, Prince of Wales-road, said she

    was the land-lady of the house. She knew the prisoner, as she had gone

    backwards and forwards to her house, where Mr. and Mrs. Hogg had lived.

    A fortnight before the murder she saw the prisoner ring the first floor

    bell. Mrs. Hogg''s mother was out, and the deceased woman came down and

    opened the door. Mrs. Hogg and the prisoner stood talking for a few

    moments, after which they both went upstairs. The prisoner remained

    there a short time. Either on the Thursday or Friday before the murder

    she heard the door-bell ring, and a boy go away from the door after

    speaking to someone. Charles Britt, a carman, having stables in

    Priory-mews, said that he was going through Priory-street on the

    afternoon of October 24th, when he saw a woman with a perambulator knock

    at the door of the house No. 2. The door was opened by a woman, but he

    could not say whether it was the prisoner. Mr. Hogg was recalled and

    asked a number of questions as to where he was working on the day of the

    murder, and his statements substantially bore out the evidence

    previously given by him. Mr. Bond, of Westminster Hospital, repeated the

    medical testimony given by him at the inquest. He said there was no

    blood in the passage or front room. The floor of the kitchen had the

    appearance of having been cleaned. He examined prisoner''s hands at

    Kentish-town Police-station after her arrest, and found several

    superficial scratches and abrasions which had been recently inflicted.

    Some of the hairs found in the prisoner''s kitchen corresponded with

    those of the deceased woman. The severing of the head would enable it to

    be doubled either under or above the body, and thus the body could be

    more easily placed in the bassinette. He could not say whether or not

    the stains in the kitchen were human blood. Professor Pepper was the

    next witness called. He deposed that he had made a post-mortem

    examination of the deceased woman and her infant child. He believed Mrs.

    Hogg''s throat was cut while the heart was beating. The child had died

    either from suffocation or exposure. He had made an examination of

    thirty-five articles found in the prisoner''s rooms. A great number of

    them were stained with blood. The prisoner, who said she would reserve

    her defence, was committed for trial.


    The Recorder, in charging the Grand Jury at the opening of the November

    sessions of the Central Criminal Court on Monday morning, said:

    Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, there have been one hundred prisoners added

    to the calendar since the last sitting of the Court; but that is not a

    large number considering the interval. I am sorry to see, however, that

    there are several cases wherein life has been lost under circumstances

    which justify charges of crime. Of those three are charges of murder and

    two of manslaughter; in addition to which there are several charges or

    attempting to murder, while there are twelve prisoners charged with

    robbery with violence. The most serious case of all is that against a

    young woman named Mary Eleanor Pearcey, who stands charged with the

    double murder of a young woman and her baby. The young woman''s name was

    Phoebe Hogg. It appears that the prisoner had been on terms of intimacy

    with the husband of the murdered woman for some years, and a long

    correspondence shows that she was devotedly attached to him, and had

    been cohabiting with him immorally for five years. About two years ago

    he was married to Phoebe Hogg, and had one child. At the time the

    offence was committed the mother and baby went by invitation of the

    prisoner to her house, and while there both were murdered—the woman

    first and afterwards her baby. The rooms showed many signs of a serious

    crime having been committed. There was blood in different parts of two

    rooms, on a portion of the prisoner''s dress, and on two knives found in

    the table drawer in the kitchen, where the violence was obviously

    perpetrated. There are, therefore, over-whelming reasons why she should

    be put upon her trial and charged with this serious offence. The crime

    having been committed in the house, where there were other persons who

    do not appear to have heard anything which particularly attracted their

    attention, the body was taken for a mile without observation. After that

    the body of the baby was taken away and thrown into a field. The

    depositions are of great length, because everyone who saw anything

    material to the charge was called before the magistrate, but it will not

    be necessary that you should go into these matters of detail. All that

    you are required to do is to see that there is such a prima facie case

    as will enable you to say that the prisoner ought to be put upon her

    trial. Probably the evidence of the policeman who went to the room and

    that of one or two others will be sufficient. The learned recorder referred

    briefly to the other charges of murder, and the grand jurors were

    dismissed to their duties.'

    "ITERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH LIFE. May 6th - SUICIDE OF A TALENTED YOUNG MAN. On Thursday
    night, Charles Evans, a talented young man of 25, took his own life by jumping
    from the second-floor window of his chambers in Kensington Court. Dr. Joseph Arnold
    Ormerod; M.D., residing at 25, Upper Imperial Street, W., identified the deceased
    as his nephew and stated that he had been suffering from influenza. Mr. Herbert
    Campbell Moore, residing at 18, Kensington Court Place, said that he occupied
    chambers with the deceased and had done so for the last seven months. They used
    the same bedroom. On Thursday night they both went to bed at ten minutes past
    twelve. The deceased seemed fairly cheerful, and witness noticed nothing wrong
    at the time. He had often seemed a little depressed but had never threatened to
    commit suicide. Soon after two o''clock on Friday morning, witness was awakened
    by the deceased jumping on him and shouting, "I am mad! Mad!" At the same time,

    at the other side of the room, and held him down. Ten minutes or a quarter of
    an hour elapsed, and Evans seemed to get worse. He said to witness, "I shall have
    the strength of a madman in a few minutes. I do not want to harm you, but I am
    afraid I shall." Soon after that, the candle began to flicker, and witness got

    said he was of the opinion that the deceased had jumped on to the chest of drawers
    in the room and then thrown himself through the window. The apartment was on the
    second floor, and the ground was 44 feet away. Mr. Cecil Berry, home surgeon,
    said that the deceased was much exhausted when admitted, and died within three
    hours, the cause of death being fracture of the spine. The body was much bruised,
    and the forehead was cut. The coroner summed up, saying it was clear that Mr.
    Moore and the deceased had had a terrible midnight struggle, and the jury returned
    a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity."'

    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    MR. TROUTBECK held an inquest, at St. George''s Hospital, with reference

    to the death of Charles Evans, twenty-two, an architect, of 18,

    Kensington-court-place, who committed suicide on the morning of the 5th

    inst. Dr. Joseph Arderne Ormerod, M.D., residing at 25, Upper

    Wimpole-street, W., identified the deceased as his nephew, and stated

    that he had heard he had been suffering from influenza. Mr. Herbert

    Campbell Moore, residing at 18, Kensington-court-place, said that he

    occupied chambers with the deceased, and had done so for the last seven

    months. They used the same bedroom. On Thursday night they both went to

    bed at ten minutes past twelve. The deceased seemed fairly cheerful, and

    witness noticed nothing the matter at the time. He had often seemed a

    little depressed, but had never threatened to commit suicide. Soon after

    two o''clock on Friday morning witness was awakened by the deceased

    jumping on him and shouting, "I am mad, mad!" at the same time tearing

    his nightdress to pieces. Witness carried him on to his bed, which was

    at the other side of the room, and held him down. Ten minutes or a

    quarter of an hour elapsed, and Evans seemed to get worse. He said to

    witness, "I shall have the strength of a madman in a few minutes. I do

    not want to hurt you, but I am afraid I shall." Soon after that the

    candle began to flicker and witness got up to light another. He had no

    sooner got up, however, than the deceased sprang upon him. Witness

    struck out at him and felled him to the ground, and they were struggling

    together on the ground for some time. Witness called to the man in the

    next suite of chambers for help, but he did not seem to hear. Finally,

    they got near the door in the struggle, and witness then managed to get

    on the top of his opponent, and held him by the throat till he became

    exhausted. Witness then ran from the room to Mr. Arnold, who occupied

    chambers downstairs, and knocked at his door. He waited there till Mr.

    Arnold came out, the deceased in the meantime having recovered, and,

    getting more excited, was running about the room, knocking the furniture

    about. They were about to enter the room together, when they heard a

    crash of breaking glass, and on getting inside they found nobody there.

    Search was made, and Evans was afterwards found lying stark naked in the

    timber yard below. By the Jury: They were quite sober when they went to

    bed. Mr. Reginald Arnold, an artist, who was called to the assistance of

    the last witness, said he was of opinion that the deceased had jumped on

    to the chest of drawers which was in the room, and then thrown himself

    through the window. The apartment was on the second floor and

    thirty-three feet from the ground. Mr. Cecil Berry, house surgeon, said

    that the deceased was much collapsed when admitted, and died within

    three hours, the cause of death being fracture of the spine. The body

    was much bruised and the forehead was cut. The coroner, in summing up,

    said it was clear that Mr. Moore and the deceased had had a terrible

    midnight struggle, and the jury returned a verdict of suicide during

    temporary insanity.'

    AT the Mansion House Ernest, Eldridge, a powerful-looking man, was

    charged with being a wandering lunatic. Sergeant Ballard stated that at

    about nine o''clock on Thursday night he was called to St. Benet''s

    Church, Queen Victoria-street, where he found the prisoner lying in one

    of the pews. He appeared to be asleep. Witness asked him what he was

    doing there, and he replied, “This church is my own. The Church is much

    higher than the law, and as you merely represent the law you. have no

    right to interfere with me.” He refused to get up or to go away, and

    witness then took hold of him to raise him up. Prisoner upon this became

    extremely violent, and kicked witness in the stomach and struck him in

    face. He was more like a madman than anything else. Three other

    constables came to witness''s assistance before the prisoner could be

    overpowered and secured Arrived at the station, the inspector thought it

    advisable to order his removal to the Bow Infirmary. There he repeated

    his violence. The doctor, however, said he was not insane, but that he

    was suffering from the effects of excessive drinking. Prisoner had with

    him in the pew a bundle, in which were a number of pieces of glass, and

    he had in his possession a good discharge, dated the 13th inst., from a

    ship on board which he had served as a sailor. Prisoner said he was very

    cold on Thursday, and entered the church to have a sleep. The alderman

    cautioned the prisoner and discharged him.

    INHUMAN TREATMENT OF A CHILD. —Dr. Macdonald, coroner for North-east

    Middlesex, on Saturday had reported to him the death of William Watson,

    aged two months, the son of a carpenter, living at Morley Avenue, Wood

    Green. It appears that the mother of the deceased died soon after the

    child''s birth, and the baby was then put out to nurse. The father,

    however, neglected to pay the sum he had agreed to for the child''s

    support, and the nurse threatened that unless he did so she would leave

    the child at his house. This threat was carried into execution, and the

    poor little thing, it is said, was left by the father lying in the

    passage for three hours in the middle of the night. The Society for the

    Prevention of Cruelty to Children hearing of the case, called in Dr.

    Maclaclin, of Alexandra-road, but death took place shortly afterwards. A

    post mortem examination has been ordered, and an inquest will be held in

    due course.


    YOUNG THIEVES. —John Fitzgibbon, eighteen, and Albert Knight, seventeen,

    pleaded guilty, at the Middlesex County Sessions, to stealing 68Ib.

    weight of lead, value 10s., the property of George German, Willesden.

    The prisoners were seen on the night of January 13th in Kilburn,

    carrying a sack containing a sack containing lead, which was afterwards

    found to have been pulled down from some new buildings in the

    neighbourhood. Mr. Halkett prosecuted, and a previous conviction was

    proved against Knight. Detective Langford gave both the prisoners a bad

    character. They were continually hanging about the neighbourhood

    committing petty thefts, and when Knight was caught on the last occasion

    Fitzgibbon was with him, but escaped. Knight was sentenced to nine

    months'' hard labour, but Fitzgibbon, as a first offender, was remanded

    in order that Mr. Wheatley, of St. Giles''s Christian Mission, might be

    written to with a view to his reclamation.'

    "TRIAL OF MRS. OSBORNE. PLEA OF GUILTY. SENTENCE OF NINE MONTHS IMPRISONMENT.

    Among the early arrivals were Major and Mrs. Hargreaves, who were seated at the
    solicitors table, and Mr. Benjamin, whose unexpected interposition in the libel
    action produced such startling results. The jury was sworn in a few minutes after
    ten. The counsel for the prosecution were Mr. Gill and Mr. Forrest Fulton, while
    for the defense Sir Charles Russell, Mr. Coward, and Mr. C. Mathews were briefed.
    Captain Osborne arrived soon after ten, and was accommodated with a seat among
    the junior counsel. The learned judge and Lord Mayor entered the court at half
    past ten.

    MRS. OSBORNE IN THE DOCK.

    Mrs. Osborne was at once brought into the dock. She was supported around the waist
    by a female warder, who helped her into a chair. She was at once charged with
    the theft and the perjury, and in an inaudible voice pleaded guilty to both charges.

    MR. FORREST FULTON said he was instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Treasury,
    and would briefly narrate facts. Justice Smith: I have all the depositions before
    me, and therefore know the facts.

    MRS. HARGREAVES SPEAKS.

    Mrs. Hargreaves: May I say, my lord? The Judge: I cannot hear you unless you are
    going to make an appeal for mercy. Mrs. Hargreaves: Indeed, I am, my lord, with
    all my heart. Sobbing.

    I have known her and loved her all her life, and am perfectly convinced she was
    not in her right mind when she took the jewels.

    THE JUDGE THEN PROCEEDED TO PASS SENTENCE, THE PRISONER, WHO WAS CRYING BITTERLY,
    STILL REMAINING SEATED. HE SAID: You stole the jewels of your friend. You converted
    them into money. You appropriated the money to your own use, and when suspicion
    pointed to you as being the actual thief, you commenced an action in order to
    vindicate your character. In that action you falsely and corruptly swore to facts
    which were intended to lead the jury to believe you did not steal the jewels.
    I do not know what would have been the result had it not been for the interposition
    of one man, who was able to produce a document with your endorsement. But I am
    sure of one thing. If your wilful and corrupt perjury had succeeded, your friends
    Major and Mrs. Hargreaves would have left that court with the stain of indelible
    ignominy upon them. Fortunately it did not succeed. This is a serious matter.
    The maximum penalty for perjury is seven years penal servitude. I am not going
    to inflict that, but I do intend to give a severe punishment for one in your position.
    I know the jewels and the misappropriated money have been returned, and all the
    costs paid, and I bear that in mind. You have been in prison for some time; you
    surrendered yourself to justice; your condition is known to me; and Mrs. Hargreaves,
    as well as your counsel, have appealed for mercy. The sentence is that you be
    imprisoned for nine months and put to such hard labor as the state of your health
    will permit.

    THE CLOSING SCENE.

    Prisoner was then carried from the dock sobbing bitterly, and apparently astounded
    at the sentence. Her husband and Mrs. Hargreaves were also deeply affected. With
    the sentence passed upon Mrs. Osborne on Wednesday the curtain falls upon as pitiable
    a drama of real life as ever was presented to the public gaze."'

    PLEA OF GUILTY.


    SENTENCE OF NINE MONTHS'' HARD LABOUR.


    [SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]


    THE closing stage in the noted pearl stealing case was reached, at the

    Central Criminal Court, on Wednesday morning, where Mrs. Osborne was

    formally indicted, before Justice Smith, for the theft of Mrs.

    Hargreaves’s jewels, and for wilful and corrupt perjury, in the libel

    action which she brought against Major and Mrs. Hargreaves. Among the

    early arrivals were Major and Mrs. Hargreaves, who were seated at the

    solicitors'' table, and Mr. Benjamin, whose unexpected interposition in

    the libel action produced such startling results. The jury were sworn in

    a few minutes after ten. The counsel for the prosecution were Mr. Gill

    and Mr. Forrest Fulton, while for the defence Sir Charles Russell, Mr.

    Coward, and Mr. C. Mathews were briefed. Captain Osborne arrived soon

    after ten, and was accommodated with a seat among the junior counsel.

    The learned judge and Lord Mayor entered the court at half-past ten.


    MRS. OSBORNE IN THE DOCK.


    Mrs. Osborne was at once brought into the dock. She was supported around

    the waist by a female warder, who helped her into a chair. She was at

    once charged with the theft and the perjury, and in an inaudible voice

    pleaded guilty to both charges. Mr. Forrest Fulton said he was

    instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Treasury, and would briefly

    narrate facts. Justice Smith: I have all the depositions before me, and

    therefore know the facts.

    am, my lord, with all my heart. (Sobbing.) I have known her and loved

    her all her life, and am perfectly convinced she was not in her right

    mind when she took the jewels.


    THE SENTENCE.


    Justice Smith then proceeded to pass sentence, the prisoner, who was

    crying bitterly, still remaining seated. He said, "You stole the jewels

    of your friend. You converted them into money. You appropriated the

    money to your own use, and when suspicion pointed to you as being the

    actual thief you commenced an action in order to vindicate your

    character. In that action you falsely and corruptly swore to facts which

    Fortunately, it did not succeed. This is a serious matter. The maximum

    penalty for perjury is seven years'' penal servitude. I am not going to

    inflict that, but I do intend to give a severe punishment for one in

    your position. I know the jewels and the misappropriated money have been

    returned, and all the costs paid, and I bear that in mind. You have been

    some time in prison; you surrendered yourself to justice; your condition

    is known to me; and Mrs. Hargreaves, as well as your counsel, have

    appealed for mercy. The sentence is that you be imprisoned for nine

    months and put to such hard labour as the state of your health will

    permit.


    THE CLOSING SCENE.


    Prisoner was then carried from the dock sobbing bitterly, and apparently

    astounded at the sentence. Her husband and Mrs. Hargreaves were also

    deeply affected.


    With the sentence passed upon Mrs. Osborne on Wednesday the curtain

    falls upon as pitiable a drama of real life as ever was presented to the

    public gaze. To comment now upon the unhappy lady''s offence and its

    punishment is needless. We need only say a last word of sympathy for her

    call attention. It was stated in the course of the trial that the Public

    Prosecutor had taken action in consequence of Mrs. Osborne''s perjury

    would not have been taken. This sudden awakening of the official

    we hope that the fact that it has required an extremely sensational

    "THE DODZ7ES1iC TRAGEDY AT HARROW - I _ _ I AT Edgware Petty Sessions, Ann Hensman,
    thirty, wife of Charles E Heasman, commercial traveller, living at The Lodge,
    Alperton, Harrow, was charged with the wilful murder of her son, Harry Le Brun,
    aged nine years, by cutting his throat with a table knife on the 27th of February.
    Further, she was accused of attempting to commit suicide by cutting her own throat.
    The accused is a woman of fine physique and preserved an attitude of stolid indifference
    throughout the proceedings. She spoke once only, and that was while the doctors''
    evidence was given. Grace Russell, housemaid in the employ of Mr. Heasman, was
    first called to testify. She deposed that on the 27th of February her mistress
    was strange in her behaviour, and retired at seven oclock in the evening. The
    next morning she arose at seven oclock and instructed the witness to dress Master
    Harry in his best suit. Before the boy was completely dressed, the accused looked
    him down into the breakfast-room. Mr. Heasman was in bed at this time. Later,
    the witness knocked at the breakfast-room door, and after a short delay, the accused
    opened it, and the witness saw the boy lying on the floor, face downwards, in
    a pool of blood. The accused called her into the room and said, "This comes of
    not telling the truth. Mind you always speak the truth." The accused then ordered
    the witness to fetch Mr. Heasman, and she complied. When she returned to the room,
    she noticed that her mistress was bleeding from a wound on the throat. Dr. Goddard
    was called by the witness, and his master arrived at the doctor''s surgery immediately
    afterwards. They returned to The Lodge, and met the accused walking away from
    the house attired in her petticoat, slippers, and a sealskin jacket. In cross-examination
    by Mr. H Humphreys, the witness said that Mr. and Mrs. Heasman were always kind
    to the boy. They purchased a lot of new clothes for him at Christmas. The little
    boy asked why he was to put his best clothes on, and the accused replied, "We
    are going out." The witness had not late noticed a wild look about the accused.
    Dr. Charles Ernest Goddard said he was called to The Lodge by the last witness
    and also by Mr. Heasman on the morning of the 27th ult., and reached the house
    at about twenty-five minutes to nine a.m. He found the accused outside the gate,
    partially dressed, and left her with her husband. He then entered the breakfast-room
    and found the boy lying near the window. Life was extinct. The blood was warm.
    There were bloodstains on the floor, and an old bread-knife stained with blood
    was lying on the white tablecloth. An examination of the boy''s neck showed that
    the wound was a deep one, extending from two inches below the left ear, passing
    in a horizontal direction, and separating all the important structures of the
    neck down to the spinal column. There were two other superficial wounds on the
    boy''s face. Death was due to hemorrhage. The wounds on the accused were superficial.
    He had attended the accused since December 1890, on and off. Nothing in her conduct
    gave him any reason to suspect that she was of unsound mind until the day before
    the occurrence, when she called at his surgery and asked whether he had heard
    that she was mad. She added that if her father committed suicide, and her mother
    was in an asylum, that was no reason why she should be mad too. It struck him
    that her mind was at breaking down, and he told her to inform her husband so that
    he wished to see him. Mr. Hensman reached home late in the evening, and the next
    thing the witness heard was the summons to attend The Lodge."'

    "THE OXFORD SCANDAL. At the Central Criminal Court, on Friday, before Justice
    Smith, Maitland Francis Morland was indicted for demanding money by menace from
    Lord Hothfield and Earl Russell. He pleaded guilty to the charge in Lord-Russells
    case, but not guilty to the other indictments. Mr. Gill prosecuted, and, in explaining
    the facts, said the accused attempted to get money from Lord''s Hothfield, Chesterfield,
    R~ussell, Ormathwaite, and Carnarvon. He had pleaded guilty to the real offence.
    He had been a law tutor at Oxford, notwithstanding the fact that in 1874 at Lewes
    Assizes he was sentenced to twelve months hard labour. The letters he had sent
    to noblemen were stereotyped almost; there was the same lining under certain words,
    and one letter was practically a reproduction of another. Once having got an answer
    from any person to whom he wrote he kept it for some time, and then used it to
    demand money. In all letters except one to Earl Russell he was Mrs. Maitland,
    but in the first to Earl Russell he was Mrs. Morland. Mr. G ill then referred
    briefly to the facts already fully reported during the hearing at Bow-street.
    Mr. Paul Taylor, for the defence, said that considering the seriousness of the
    offence to which the prisoner had pleaded guilty, he had felt unable to advise
    him to adopt any other course than to throw himself upon the mercy of the Court.
    He was utterly unable to explain the prisoner''s motive. The mania for letter
    writing seemed to have seized him four years since, and was inexplicable, but
    it would be admitted there was no woman in the case. The female was entirely the
    creation of the prisoner''s brain. Morland had done honourable service as coach
    at Oxford, and although he was convicted twenty years since for perjury he had
    wiped out that stain by good conduct. He hoped the judge would bear in mind his
    old age and would deal leniently with the prisoner. The prisoner, whose white
    hair and venerable features make him look even older than his years, sobbed piteously
    while counsel pleaded on his behalf. When asked whether he wished to say anything,
    Morland asserted that he alone was to blame, and declared that his wife and daughter
    were entirely innocent of all complicity in the writing of letters. His wife had
    led the purest of lives, and was unknown to Earl Russell, and his daughter knew
    no more of the matter than if they had never existed. His establishment at Oxford
    was always conducted on the strictest moral principles, and he could only appeal
    to the judge to be merciful to him in his old age, and to deal with him so that
    he might die in the midst of his family instead of in prison. Might the Judge

    the children had gone out marketing, leaving them undressed and in bed

    in her room, which is on the second floor. Shortly afterwards the

    landlady, a Mrs. Woolley, noticed a smell of fire, and proceeding to

    smoke and the bed in flames. The fire was not extinguished till after

    the firemen had arrived, and they found the charred remains of the elder

    girl on the floor, while the baby, also dead, was lying in the bed. At

    the time Mrs. Rofe went out leaving her children there was a fire in the

    must have got out of bed to play with the light, and that, accidentally

    setting her night gown on fire, she rushed to the bed and ignited the

    bed clothes. The father of the deceased children, a barge beaker, was

    away at work at the time of the occurrence.

    A BRAVE MAN KILLED. —On Friday afternoon a sad accident happened to

    Henry Ambert, a labourer in the employ of the Kensal-green Gas Works. He

    was engaged on some repairs of the Gas Company just below the

    Brondesbury Bridge, crossing the London and North-Western Railway in

    Willesden-lane, when a horse attached to a heavily-laden cart belonging

    to Messrs. Bowyer, the contractors, took fright at the whistling of a

    locomotive and dashed down the incline at a great speed. Ambert rushed

    forward and endeavoured to check the horse by grasping the reins, but,

    missing his hold, fell under the wheels, which passed over his chest,

    crushing him dreadfully. The poor fellow was as speedily as possible

    removed to St. Mary’s Hospital, but life was extinct ere he arrived

    there.'

    other articles, some certificates of the most value to her, and ran off. Another
    at the same time said, ''All right, lady, I''ll run and catch him,'' and both
    disappeared. On Monday last the prisoner Fay called at her residence and told
    her that he was aware of her loss and of the identity of those who had occasioned
    it, and that he was in a position to get her back at least part of it. He produced
    a pocket-book that had been in the bag in evidence of this, and it was arranged
    that he should bring the other articles the next evening. But meanwhile Mrs. Kent
    communicated with the police, and when he arrived Detectives Hailstone and Temblett
    were already hidden behind the tapestry curtains, from which they emerged at an
    opportune moment, and arrested Fay. In consequence of a statement made by him
    at the station, Inspector George Payne, of the L Division, went to a house in
    Blackfriars-road at half-past four on Wednesday morning, and there found Gray
    in bed. He told him he should arrest him, and he replied that he knew all about
    it. In the course of the afternoon both men made statements in each other''s presence.
    Payne was to the effect that he was in the kitchen of the house in Blackfriars-road
    when Gray came in with three men, named Irwin, Cook, and Simpson, who were in
    possession of the stolen property. They spoke of putting the things on the fire,
    when Payne said that the papers might be of value, and looked at them. Finding
    the address of Mrs. Kent, he suggested that the bag and its contents should not
    be burnt, but that he should take it back to the owner. This was agreed to, and
    he took it and looked it up. Gray''s statement confirmed this, with the exception
    that he said he was already in the kitchen when Irwin, Cook, and Simpson came
    in. Inspector Payne added that two of the men named were then in custody, and
    had been charged at the Southwark Police-court on information already given to

    "A WARNING TO YOUNG WOMEN, AT the Marylebone Police-court, a smartly-dressed half-caste,
    named Archibald Johnstone, aged twenty-eight, who described himself as a gentleman,
    of Hill street, Kensington, was brought up on a warrant by Detective-inspector
    Robson, D Division, as a convict out on license who was getting his living by
    honest means. Mary Meacher, who looked about thirty-five years of age, said she
    was a corset-maker and resided at 26, New Cavendish street, Oxford street. She
    was with a female friend at Rotten Row, Hyde Park, in September last and met the
    prisoner, who introduced himself by saying, ''Good evening.'' She responded, and
    he walked with them to some chairs, where they all three sat down and entered
    into conversation. When they parted, he made an appointment to meet witness on
    the following Wednesday. On the Tuesday evening, however, she was going out for
    a walk, and opposite the house where she lived, she saw the prisoner. They went
    into Regent''s Park and parted about ten o''clock. He made several appointments
    but did not keep them. The next time she met him was at Oxford Circus, when he
    asked for the loan of £5, promising to repay her with £2 interest. She refused,
    and he remarked, ''You can if you like, and you must.'' She afterwards told him
    she wished to have nothing more to do with him. He said, ''Oh, that is the decision
    you have come to; then I shall tell everyone that you are a bad woman.'' Since
    then, she had received letters and postcards from the prisoner, in which he made
    disgraceful assertions which were not true. The magistrate asked if there had

    MR. WOOD, deputy-coroner, held an inquiry at Woolwich into the death of

    Henry Cook, pensioner, 92, Brookhill-road, Woolwich, in connection with

    whose death a man named McCall was charged before the stipendiary at

    Woolwich and remanded. Deceased’s widow stated that she and her husband

    were in the Sussex Arms when McCall spoke offensively to her, and her

    husband resented it, on which McCall struck him, and he fell back.

    William G. Bailey, an engineer, said he was present, and heard the

    dispute between Mrs. Cook and McCall, when deceased pushed McCall rather

    roughly. McCall then pushed his fist in deceased’s jaw, saying he did

    not want to have anything to do with him. Deceased fell back, and his

    head struck the edge of a seat. A doctor was called, and all that

    deceased said was to tell his wife to pay him. Dr. Fairland deposed to

    having made a post mortem examination. There were no external marks of

    violence beyond a small cut half-an-inch long at the back of the head,

    apparently caused by falling against a hard substance. Death resulted

    from the fall, which need not necessarily have been a violent one. He

    found no marks of a blow with the fist. The jury, in returning a verdict

    of accidental death, censured McCall and expressed a hope that it would

    be a warning to him in future. Mr. Greenup appeared for McCall, who,

    having been admitted to bail, was present, and expressed his regret at

    what had occurred.

    "Sadly Neglected Children. Henry Howx, who called himself a jobbing carpenter
    and furniture porter, with no fixed abode, was charged at the Westminster Police
    Court with cruelty and neglect to his three children, aged respectively six, eight,
    and ten. On the first instance, a constable saw the prisoner begging at public
    houses with three wretchedly-clad little girls, and heard him use very bad language
    to them. The children were in a fearfully neglected state, and after the prisoner
    was arrested, inquiries were made which resulted in the present prosecution. It
    was given in evidence that in February last the family occupied an underground
    kitchen in Kennington-lane, and that from there the mother of the girls (prisoner''s
    wife) was removed to the workhouse infirmary, dying from consumption. Agnes Thompson,
    wife of a gas works foreman, deposed that she was a lodger in the same house,
    and that both before and after the removal of the mother, the children were half-starved
    and filthy. Witness had heard the poor woman groaning and the children crying,
    but she could only help them to a limited extent. She had given the little girls
    food, and had known them make their way to the top of the house to beg for bread.
    One night, after the mother''s death, witness went for a policeman, as the children
    were huddled together on the stones without fire, light, food, covering, or furniture.
    The only thing in the room was a tin pail. There were four panes of glass out
    of the windows, and it was freezing hard and snowing heavily. Prisoner''s practice
    was to come home drunk between twelve and one in the morning. He went out about
    ten in the day, and did not trouble about the children at all. Police-constable
    122 L fully corroborated the foregoing evidence as to the condition of the children
    and room. He found the little girls only in rags, and booked them to the workhouse.
    The very day after the children had been cleansed and looked after in the workhouse,
    the prisoner took them out, though he had no home or habitation, and that from
    that time forth and till lately he had been with his family in and out of various
    workhouses, sending the little ones out to beg in the daytime and taking the money
    they obtained. Three months'' hard labor. The children were taken care of by an

    "TWI ROAD TO RUIN. John Gardner, of 21, Newington-green-road, Stoke Newington,
    was charged before Sir John Btidge, at Southwark, with fraud, indecent assault,
    and conspiracy. The specific allegations were that the prisoner conspired with
    Louis Leon Goldstein, otherwise Harry Roberts, to obtain by fraud £21 and other
    goods from Mrs. Holton, in 1889 and 1890, and also indecently assaulting her.
    Mr. Lewis said that he appeared to prosecute on behalf of Mr. Labouchere, the
    proprietor of Ruth. The prisoner was charged with Smith indecent assault and conspiracy
    with a man named Goldstein, alias Harry Roberts, to fleece servant girls of their
    money. On the 10th of December, 1891, an article was published in Truth, called
    "The Road to Ruin," charging the prisoner with carrying on all sorts of immoral
    traffic in Stamford-street, and citing Mr. Labouchere as having done a public
    service by bringing them to justice. Inspector Henry Marsall, of the E. Division,
    said he received warrants for the arrest of the prisoner and Goldstein on March
    7th. He found that the house at 165, Stamford-street, where Goldstein had carried
    on business as Roberts, was shut up, and that he had absconded. He also found
    that the prisoner had also left his lodgings and absconded. He was unable to trace
    him until that morning, when at half-past seven he found him at 21, Newington-green-road,
    Stoke Newington. He said to him, "I am Inspector Marshall and hold a warrant for
    your arrest." The prisoner denied having committed any fraud with Goldstein and
    said he was simply his paid servant. Upon reading the warrant charging him with
    indecent assault, he denied having assaulted the girl. What he had done in the
    matter, he said, was as a servant to Roberts under his instructions. Witness said,
    "What about the action against Labouchere; you took active part in that?" The
    prisoner said, "I was goaded on to that by Roberts and by a solicitor. I signed
    papers without reading them." Prisoner, who said he had nothing to say, was remanded.

    JOHN JAMES GARDNER, of 21, Newington-green-road, Stoke Newington, was

    charged before Sir John Bridge, at Bow-street, with fraud, indecent

    assault, and conspiracy. The specific allegations were that the prisoner

    conspired with Louis Leon Goldstein, otherwise Harry Roberts, to obtain

    by fraud £21 and other sums from Lily Holton, in 1889 and 1800, and also

    indecently assaulting her. Mr. Lewis said that he appeared to prosecute

    on behalf of Mr. Labouchere, the proprietor of Truth. The prisoner was

    charged with indecent assault and conspiracy with a man named Goldstein,

    alias Harry Roberts, to fleece servant girls of their money. On the 10th

    of December, 1891, an article was published in Truth, called “The

    Stamford-street, Road to Ruin," charging the prisoner with carrying on

    an abdominal traffic in Stamford-street under the guise of a school for

    preparing girls for the stage and music-halls. Roberts brought an action

    for libel against Mr. Labouchere, which was dismissed on the ground that

    the statements were true. Prisoner brought a criminal action, which was

    dismissed by the Lord Mayor, which stated that the statements in Truth

    were true, and were published for the public benefit. Both men then

    absconded, and Goldstein had not since been discovered. Mr. Lewis

    trusted that the magistrate would be satisfied that the prisoner and

    Goldstein carried on a disgraceful traffic, and that Mr. Labouchere had

    done a public service in bringing them to justice. Inspector Henry

    Marshall, of the E Division, said he received warrants for the arrest of

    the prisoner and of Goldstein on March 7th. He found that the house 165,

    Stamford-street, at which Goldstein had carried on business as Roberts,

    was shut up, and that he had absconded. He found that the prisoner had

    also left his lodgings and absconded. He was unable to trace him until

    that morning, when at half-past seven he found him at 21,

    Newington-green-road, Stoke Newington. He saw him receive a letter from

    a postman at the door. He said to him, "I am Inspector Marshall and

    hold a warrant for your arrest. believe your name is J. Gardner." He

    said, "Yes." Witness entered a room in which he had been sleeping, and

    read the warrant to him in the presence of Sergeant Partridge. He said,

    "I deny having committed any fraud with Goldstein. I was simply his paid

    servant." Upon reading the warrant charging him with indecent assault,

    he said, "I deny having assaulted the girl. What I have done in the

    matter has been as a servant to Roberts and under his instructions."

    Witness said, "What about the action against Labouchere; you took an

    active part in that?" He said, "I was goaded on to that by Roberts and

    by a solicitor. I signed papers without reading them.” Prisoner, who

    said he had nothing to say, was remanded.


    AN EXTRAORDINARY SUICIDE


    MARIE LALOIS, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a retired colonel in

    the French army, has committed suicide at Algiers, under the most

    extraordinary circumstances. She had for some time been engaged to a

    young man of excellent family, named Eugene Lafont, and they quarrelled.

    On Friday night the girl, after returning from a dance, chatted with her

    father for a while, insisting upon filling his pipe, and then kissing

    him good night, asked him, apparently in a jesting way, how he thought

    he could get along without her. The colonel made some affectionate

    reply. She then said, “Well, you had better make up your mind; you may

    soon have to do so;" and then blowing a kiss to her father—which the

    latter responded to with a playful shake of his finger—the young girl

    retired to her room. She was never seen alive

    again. It is assumed that she undressed herself, put on her nightdress,

    and then deliberately cut up the sheets, making them into a kind of

    rope. She then attached one end of the improvised rope to the balcony,

    and formed the other into a noose which she tightened round her neck.

    She must then have thrown herself out of the window. Next morning, at an

    early hour, some passers-by were horrified to notice the body of the

    young girl, attired in nothing but a thin nightdress, dangling between

    the first and second storeys in front of the house. They

    immediately gave the alarm. The body was cut down in the presence of the father,
    whose

    wild grief evoked expressions of the deepest sympathy. The medical men

    who were called in express the belief that the body must have been

    hanging from the window for at least five hours before it was

    discovered.'

    "ATTEMPTED MURDER AND RAPE IN STROOD.

    A sensational case of attempted murder and rape came before the magistrates at
    Strood on Saturday, when Frederick Marrs was brought up charged with feloniously
    wounding his wife at Strood with intent to murder her. The woman is in a dying
    condition, and her depositions were taken in the course of the day.

    Yesterday morning, at three o''clock, Mrs. Marrs was aroused from her sleep by
    her husband striking her on the head with a shoemaker''s hammer. She jumped out
    of bed and struggled to take the hammer away from him, but he seized her by the
    throat and tore the flesh away, laying bare the windpipe. She could not get away
    from Marrs, who struck blow after blow with the hammer, hitting her on the head
    and face. Finally, he dragged her to the staircase and attempted to throw her
    down; but she managed to tear herself away and escape into a neighbouring house.
    It was then found that her features were battered out of recognition. Her nose
    was laid open from the forehead to the tip, the right cheekbone was broken, the
    right ear was torn apparently with the hook of the hammer, both eyes were blackened
    and closed, and one rib was fractured.

    The prisoner appeared to be in a dazed condition, and seemed to have little recollection
    of the terrible course of events; and the magistrates, without going into the
    case, remanded him. It appears that Marrs married the woman about sixteen years
    ago, and since then he has been idle and dissolute, his wife having to go out
    to work to keep him. Latterly he had been drinking more heavily than usual, and
    was in a condition bordering upon delirium tremens."

    INTENSE excitement was caused in Stood, a town adjoining the city of

    Rochester, early Friday morning by the report that a shoemaker named

    Frederick Marrs had nearly succeeded in murdering his wife and son, aged

    fifteen. It seems that Marrs attacked his wife with a hammer at three

    a.m. After receiving nine terrible wounds on her head she managed to

    escape into a neighbour''s house. The infuriated shoemaker then turned

    upon his son, who, by leaping from the top of the stairs to the bottom,

    managed to escape into the street and inform the police of what had

    occurred. A constable soon arrived on the scene, and conveyed Marrs to

    the cells of the Rochester Police-station, where he attempted suicide by

    tying a scarf tightly round his neck. Blood was issuing from his ears

    and he was nearly dead when the constable in charge happened to look

    into his cell, saw the man''s condition, rushed in, and took the scarf

    off. The woman is in a dying condition, and her depositions were taken

    in the course of the day.


    Frederick Marrs, was brought before the magistrates at Strood, on

    Saturday, charged with feloniously wounding his wife at Strood with

    intent to murder her. The woman, who is lying in a very critical

    condition, was visited on Friday night by the magistrates, who took her

    depositions in the presence of the prisoner. The room in which the

    assault was committed was in a terrible condition. The furniture was

    smashed to pieces and the floor was saturated with blood.


    Mrs. Marrs stated that she was aroused from her sleep at three o''clock

    on Friday morning by her husband striking her on the head with a

    shoemaker''s hammer. She jumped out of bed and struggled to take the

    hammer away from him, but he seized her by the throat, and in his frenzy

    tore the flesh away, laying bare the wind-pipe. She could not get away

    from Marrs, who struck blow after blow with the hammer, hitting her on

    the head and face. Finally, he dragged her to the staircase, and

    attempted to throw her down; but she managed to tear herself away, and

    escaped into a neighbouring house. It was then found that her features

    were battered out of recognition. Her nose was laid open from the

    forehead to the tip, the right cheek-bone was broken, the right ear was

    torn apparently with the hook of the hammer, both eyes were blackened

    and closed, and one rib was fractured.


    The prisoner appeared to be in a dazed condition, and seemed to have

    little recollection of the terrible occurrence; and the magistrates,

    without going into the case, remanded him. It appears that Marrs married

    BEFORE the Kingston-on Thames Bench, a well-dressed young woman, named

    Bridget Donovan, twenty-one years of age, was brought up on remand

    charged with stealing from the Oak Hotel, Surbiton, between a date in

    February this year and the 4th of April a jacket and a sunshade, value

    £5, the property of Helen Newton, wife of Mr. Harry Isaac Newton, the

    landlord. Mr. G. Washington Fox appeared to prosecute, and Mr. T. Young

    defended. Mrs. Newton stated that the prisoner had been employed at the

    Oak Hotel as housemaid since Christmas last, and was given notice to

    leave in consequence of misbehavior. Witness was away from home from the

    19th of February until the 5th of April, and upon returning on the

    latter date discovered that a large number of articles belonging to her

    had been stolen, and the plate and jewellery to the amount of about £50

    were also gone. Witness went to 22, Adelaide-road, Penge, where the

    prisoner was employed as a domestic servant, and there identified the

    jacket and the sunshade produced. The prisoner, she understood, had

    obtained this situation without giving a character. In answer to Mr.

    Young, the prisoner said that the articles were left in charge of her

    husband and her mother, but the prisoner had access to them.

    Police-constable Johnson, stationed at Penge, deposed to arresting the

    prisoner at 22, Adelaide-road, Penge, when she produced the jacket and

    the sunshade, alleging that she bought the jacket at a wardrobe shop at

    Walton, and that the sunshade was given to her. Detective sergeant

    Morley stated that inquiries had been made to try and recover the

    remainder of the stolen property, but without success, the prisoner

    denying all knowledge of it. Mr. Young then addressed the magistrate for

    the defence, putting stress upon the hitherto respectable character of

    the prisoner, as well as upon that of her parents, in Hersham. She had

    formerly been in the service of the Duchess of Albany, at Claremont,

    Esher. The magistrates dealt with her under the First Offenders’ Act,

    and bound her over in the sum of £10 to come up for judgment when called

    "THE ILLUSTRIOUS POLICE NEWS. SATURDAY, JULY 23, 1892. Is it possible that the
    defeated party in Mid-lothian are to be ungenerous enough to worry E Mr. Gladstone
    with another contest? A correspondent informs us that Colonel Wauchope has consented
    to contest Mr. Gladstone''s seat if he has to stand for re-election. The colonel
    refused to do this till it was pointed out to him that Mr. Gladstone''s remarks
    at Aberdeen, explaining the decrease of his majority, were virtually a challenge
    to another fight. Mr. Gladstone said that he had been deserted by many of his
    old supporters, who oppose disestablishment unless there is a preliminary appeal
    to the Scottish people. He, however, indiscreetly claimed that the majority in
    his favor showed that those who hold this opinion must be in a minority in Midlothian.
    Many of them now say they supported Mr. Gladstone, as of old, on account of his
    Home Rule and on general grounds, not considering that the Church question was
    directly before the electors. As adherents of the Established Church, they complain
    that Mr. Gladstone is counting votes given to him on other grounds as votes given
    for disestablishment. In this connection it may be of interest to recall the fact
    that about two years ago Midlothian was polled by circular on the disestablishment
    question, just as Edinburgh was when it was proposed to give Mr. Parnell the freedom
    of the city. In Scotland they are rather given to this method of testing local
    opinion on difficult points. Sixty percent of the registered electors of Midlothian,
    in answer to the circular, said they were against disestablishment. The Irish
    vote in Midlothian, however, is about seven hundred-some say a thousand-strong.
    At its two remaining meetings before the holidays, the London County Council will
    be chiefly engaged in discussing the various schemes for which it is proposed
    to seek parliamentary powers in the next Session of the House of Commons. By one
    of the standing orders of the Council these schemes must be submitted before the
    end of July, in order to give the Parliamentary Committee due time for their preparation.
    The batch of proposals includes four large public works of great importance to
    Londoners. There is, first, the scheme for the new thoroughfare from Holborn to
    the Strand, and the clearance of the Holywell Street block. The estimated cost
    of this will be just over �0,000,000. Secondly, there is the proposal for making
    a southern approach to the new Tower Bridge. This is a massive project taking
    a new thoroughfare, sixty feet wide from the Tower Bridge to the Old Kent Road,
    sweeping through densely populated Bermondsey. The cost of this will be just under
    �50,000."

    proposals includes four large public works of great importance to

    Londoners. There is, first, the scheme for the new thoroughfare from

    Holborn to the Strand, and the clearance of the Holy- well-street block.

    The estimated cost of this will be just over £2,000,00. Secondly, there

    is the proposal for making a southern approach to the new Tower-bridge.

    This is a plan for taking a new thoroughfare, sixty feet wide, from the

    Tower-bridge to the Old Kent-road, sweeping through densely- populated

    Bermondsey. The cost of this will be just under £50,000.'
