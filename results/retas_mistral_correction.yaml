    about a minute, listening. Then he

    He listened some more; then he

    come tip-toeing down and stood

    right between us; we could a touched

    him, nearly. Well, likely it was min

    utes and minutes that there warn''t a

    sound, and we all there so close

    together. There was a place on my

    ankle that got to itching ; but I

    dasn''t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right be

    tween my shoulders. Seemed like I''d die if I couldn''t scratch. Well, I''ve

    noticed that thing plenty of times since. If you are with the quality, or at a

    I knows what Ps gwyne to do. Ps gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears

    So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up

    against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of

    mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But

    of

    the widow''s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn''t scrape our

    heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a

    noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson''s big nigger,

    named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty

    clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched his
